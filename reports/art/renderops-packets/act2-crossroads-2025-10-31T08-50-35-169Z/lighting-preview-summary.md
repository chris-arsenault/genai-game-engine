## Notes

- Safehouse floor and branch walkway remain `skipped` because their overlays are not controlled via the derivative pipeline; they rely on base material lighting and need manual confirmation during the in-engine review.
- All evaluable overlays remain within their luminance tolerance ranges following the Session 114 recalibration.
- Re-run `node scripts/art/previewCrossroadsLighting.js --out=reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json` after any RenderOps adjustments to keep this report in sync.
