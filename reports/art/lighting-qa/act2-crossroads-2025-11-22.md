# Act 2 Crossroads Lighting QA — 2025-11-22

## Overview
- Reviewed `reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json` generated for packet `act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T09-10-32-089Z`.
- Verified 12/12 segments report `status: ok`; no hotspots, metadata drift, or missing overlays flagged.
- Cross-referenced `reports/art/luminance-snapshots/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-luminance-2025-11-01T09-10-40-170Z.json` to confirm numeric parity with the preview.

## Findings
- **Floors** – Safehouse, briefing pad, branch walkway, selection pad, and checkpoint plaza remain within ±0.05 luminance deviation; walkways retain stealth readability.
- **Accents** – Selection conduit hover band projects 0.485 luminance against a 0.46 target (∆ +0.025 < 0.08 threshold); no bloom spill risk detected.
- **Light Columns / Glows** – Checkpoint glow/columns and safehouse columns sit below target by 0.02–0.05, providing the intended noir contrast without falling outside tolerance.
- No skipped segments; derivative overlays fully synchronized with derivative manifests.

## Decision
- Lighting QA approved for RenderOps packet `9cc27c03-3b58-4c29-8c71-36dfe28507ae`.
- Proceed with acknowledgement and delivery record updates during Session 237.
