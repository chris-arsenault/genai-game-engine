# Autonomous Development Session #153 – Traversal Gating UX & Save Parity

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 20m  
**Focus**: Surface traversal-denial blockers directly in the travel overlay and close the WorldStateStore ↔ SaveManager parity gap for new slices.

## Summary
- Wired `navigation:movement_blocked` events into `DistrictTravelOverlay` so traversal denials automatically reveal blockers and focus the relevant district entry.
- Added focused Jest + Playwright coverage for the gating flow and overlay event handling to lock in the UX behaviour across unit and E2E layers.
- Extended SaveManager parity tests to include the new district and NPC slices, verifying snapshot/hydration align with the expanded WorldStateStore contract.
- Refreshed backlog and documentation to capture the new automation and adjusted next steps for M3-013 and M3-022.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/DistrictTravelOverlay.js`
- `src/game/Game.js`
- `tests/game/ui/DistrictTravelOverlay.events.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/district-travel-traversal.spec.js`
- `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- `docs/reports/autonomous-session-153-handoff.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/ui/DistrictTravelOverlay.events.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/district-travel-traversal.spec.js`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Monitor the new traversal-denial Playwright spec in CI and iterate on overlay messaging/telemetry once branch navigation scenes go live (M3-022).
2. Coordinate with M3-016 to wire the expanded WorldStateStore snapshot into full Save/Load flows and autosave/export hooks.
3. Re-run particle runtime stress tests once bespoke particle sheets arrive to validate throttling thresholds against final art.
4. Continue monitoring the FX metrics Playwright scenario to keep deterministic sampler helpers honest as new cues land.
5. Schedule resumed implementation windows for M2-001/M3-001/M3-008 after save-state objectives stabilize.
6. Pull AR-003 sprite batch into the next bespoke slot and validate runtime art on delivery.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated `M3-022` with traversal-denial integration, new automated coverage, and next steps focused on telemetry/CI monitoring.
- Updated `M3-013` with SaveManager parity verification for district/NPC slices and adjusted next steps to coordinate with M3-016.
- Logged session details in `docs/plans/backlog.md` under Session #153.

## Notes
- `playwright-results.xml` reset to avoid checking in transient test artifacts after local runs.
