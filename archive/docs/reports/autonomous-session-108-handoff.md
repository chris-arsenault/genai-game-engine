# Autonomous Development Session #108 - Debug Budget Controls & AR-050 Sourcing
**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h05m  
**Status**: Debug overlay budget tuning shipped with UI + tests; AR-050 manifest extended with plaza/boundary references; analytics outbox still awaiting acknowledgment.

---

## Highlights
- Added inline budget controls to the debug HUD so QA can adjust SystemManager thresholds without using the console, backed by sanitisation helpers and Jest coverage.
- Sourced CC0/CC-BY imagery for the Act 2 Crossroads selection pad, checkpoint plaza floor, and boundary wall overlays, recording licensing metadata in manifests and inventory docs.
- Reconfirmed the 2025-11-12 telemetry parity package remains in the analytics outbox with no acknowledgement and logged the follow-up in QUEST-610 plus session notes.

---

## Deliverables
- Engine/UI: `index.html`, `src/main.js`, `src/game/ui/helpers/systemBudget.js`.
- Tests: `tests/game/ui/helpers/systemBudget.test.js`.
- Asset pipeline: `assets/images/requests.json`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`.
- Backlog & docs: `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/outbox/act2-crossroads-20251112/README.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- systemBudget`
- `npm test -- systemMetricsDebugView`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **AR-050 column overlays** – Safehouse/checkpoint column beams (`image-ar-050-crossroads-column-*`) still need CC0/CC-BY references or generation prompts.
2. **Overlay derivative prep** – Newly sourced references must be processed into transparent overlays with usage notes; track in AR-050 next steps.
3. **Analytics ingestion** – `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/outbox/act2-crossroads-20251112` remains unacknowledged; follow up with analytics before dispatching the next parity package (QUEST-610).
4. **RenderOps validation** – Lighting preset re-run still pending after overlay changes; coordinate scheduling once asset sourcing stabilises.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Ping analytics for parity package receipt, log response in QUEST-610, and plan the subsequent telemetry dispatch timing.
- Continue AR-050 by sourcing column beam overlays and preparing generation briefs for remaining AR-001–AR-005 UI assets.
- Convert today’s references into overlay derivatives and capture processing notes in manifests once complete.
- Schedule the RenderOps hardware lighting validation pass and capture any hotspot adjustments in backlog/docs.

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated AR-050 (`3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`) completed work + next steps, reflecting new sources and derivative tasks.
- Logged DEBUG-332 (`27d58033-9ee7-4977-abb1-c092ef8bac1a`) as completed for the debug HUD budget controls with testing notes.
- Extended QUEST-610 (`ad127fe7-76c7-4ba2-8aca-9513b89c07d3`) notes with today’s ingestion status check and follow-up reminder.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Budget input clamps to 0.5–50 ms and keeps `window.debugSystemBudgetMs` in sync so scripted tooling still reads the latest threshold.
