# Autonomous Development Session #53 – Tutorial Automation Deep Dive

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~55m (Start ≈2025-10-29T05:31:41Z – End ≈2025-10-29T06:26:33Z)  
**Status**: Tutorial Playwright coverage expanded; detective vision telemetry aligned; backlog/docs synced.

---

## Executive Summary
- Extended the tutorial Playwright pack to exercise evidence collection, clue derivation, and detective vision beats using real ECS interactions.
- Updated `InvestigationSystem` to emit `ability:activated` for detective vision so tutorial context transitions register during automation.
- Refreshed backlog and changelog entries to capture the broader tutorial automation scope and remaining UI coverage deliverables.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Playwright tutorial coverage**: Added evidence collection and clue derivation assertions plus detective vision activation to `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`, ensuring tutorial steps progress via production systems.
- **Ability telemetry alignment**: `InvestigationSystem.activateDetectiveVision()` now emits `ability:activated` alongside the existing audio event, allowing TutorialSystem context to flip `detectiveVisionUsed` during automated runs (`src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js`).
- **Backlog/documentation sync**: QA-201 backlog item now reflects the new automation coverage with updated next steps, and the changelog records the expanded tutorial tests (`docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`).

---

## Verification
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`
- `npm test -- InvestigationSystem.test`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Tutorial UI automation gap**: Case file and deduction board prompts remain manual; need Playwright coverage to retire QA checklists.
2. **Automation documentation**: Consolidate tutorial automation troubleshooting guidance and artifact retention process once UI coverage lands.
3. **Benchmark follow-through**: Adaptive audio benchmark still needs CI wiring to surface regressions automatically.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 4 (`src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js`, `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`)
- **New/Updated Tests**: 2 new Playwright scenarios (`collects evidence...`, `activates detective vision...`) validated against the real ECS loop

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Automate the remaining tutorial prompts (case file, deduction board, forensic analysis) to complete QA-201.
- Draft tutorial automation troubleshooting notes (expected event telemetry, selectors, reset helpers) for docs once UI interactions are scripted.
- Begin integrating the adaptive audio infiltration benchmark into CI dashboards and alerting.

---

## Artifact Locations
- Tutorial Playwright updates: `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`
- Detective vision telemetry hook: `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js`
- Backlog & changelog sync: `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
