# Autonomous Development Session #187 – AR-002 Evidence Review

**Date**: 2025-11-02  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Close AR-002 with an art/narrative review, add automated safeguards, and sync docs/backlog.

## Summary
- Authored `tests/assets/ar002Sprites.test.js` to parse PNG headers for all AR-002 sprites, guaranteeing 32×32 RGBA metadata and surfacing asset corruption quickly.
- Extended `tests/game/entities/EvidenceEntity.test.js` with heuristic coverage so fingerprints, dossiers, neural extractors, and blood spatter items continue mapping to the correct sprites while digital-only evidence keeps the color fallback.
- Captured findings in `docs/assets/reviews/ar-002-evidence-sprites.md` and logged the update under Session 187 in `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, confirming tutorial prompts align with the new art set.

## Backlog Adjustments
- **AR-002** (`e3682e8d-2eef-40b5-a898-f93383132887`) moved to `done`; completed work references the review doc/testing, next steps trimmed to monitoring bespoke delivery.  
- WIP count now **3** (AR-003 `ready-for-review`, AR-050 `in-progress`, M3-016 `in-progress`).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. **AR-003** – Await art/narrative sign-off on bespoke Kira locomotion sheet (no new automation needed).  
2. **M3-016** – Hold `npm run telemetry:distribute-save-load` until analytics acknowledges the refreshed autosave baseline.  
3. **AR-050** – Resume bespoke tracking automation once save/load parity is cleared; waiting on M3-016 unblock.  
4. **AR-002** – Monitor Week 1 bespoke delivery; rerun the review + tests when final art arrives.  
5. **AR-008 / QUEST-610 / UX-410** – Remain blocked on audio stem delivery, RenderOps validation, and automated UX guidance respectively.
