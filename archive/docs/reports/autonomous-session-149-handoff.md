# Autonomous Development Session #149 – Debug Audio Overlay Ergonomics

**Date**: November 10, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 20m  
**Focus**: Keyboard accessibility polish for the debug audio overlay.

---

## Summary
- Implemented a Shift+Alt+A shortcut that opens the debug audio panel, applies a focus trap, and returns focus to the game canvas on Escape so QA/audio designers can work mouse-free.
- Added keyboard navigation helpers for SFX tag chips and catalog rows, including focus outlines, Tab cycling safeguards, and arrow-key traversal.
- Updated HUD styling to highlight focused chips/rows and documented the shortcut inside the overlay.

---

## Deliverables
- `index.html`
- `src/main.js`
- `tests/e2e/debug-overlay-audio-accessibility.spec.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/debug-overlay-audio-accessibility.spec.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Re-run particle runtime stress tests once bespoke particle sheets arrive to validate throttling thresholds against final art (carried forward).
2. Continue monitoring the FX metrics Playwright scenario to ensure future cue additions surface deterministic sampler helpers before automation depends on them.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Marked `UX-173: Debug Audio Overlay Ergonomics` as **done** in MCP with verification notes.
- Logged the keyboard accessibility improvements under “Session #149 Backlog Updates” in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

---

## Notes
- Escape now restores focus to the main canvas so designers can immediately resume gameplay input after inspecting audio telemetry.
