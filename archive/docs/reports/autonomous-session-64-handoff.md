# Autonomous Development Session #64 – HUD Telemetry Panels

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h12m (Start ≈2025-10-30T09:05:00-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-30T10:17:00-07:00)  
**Status**: SaveInspector HUD overlay, reputation cascade telemetry, and tutorial timelines now surface without devtools, backed by new unit + Playwright coverage and refreshed docs.

---

## Executive Summary
- Implemented `SaveInspectorOverlay` HUD panel that consumes `SaveManager.getInspectorSummary()` with WorldStateStore fallbacks so QA can inspect cascade/tutorial telemetry directly in-canvas.
- Updated player-facing overlays (Reputation, Tutorial) and game controls to surface cascade hotspots, tutorial snapshot timelines, and SaveInspector toggling; integrated with `Game.update()` edge detection.
- Added Jest suites for the new overlay + telemetry subscriptions and a focused Playwright smoke (`hud-telemetry.spec.js`) that seeds cascade/tutorial events, opening overlays with resilient fallbacks to avoid headless input flakiness.
- Documented the HUD telemetry flow in `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, extended the tutorial automation guide, and synchronized backlog item `DEBUG-248` with the new coverage and remaining export follow-up.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **New HUD overlay**: `src/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.js` renders cascade metrics, top targets, and tutorial timeline; `Game` wires it into initialization, update, render, and cleanup while `Controls` adds the `[O]` binding.
- **Telemetry-aware overlays**: `ReputationUI` now subscribes to cascade summaries, `TutorialOverlay` exposes snapshot telemetry, and `SaveManager.getInspectorSummary()` supplies inspector data with store fallbacks.
- **Automation updates**: `tests/e2e/hud-telemetry.spec.js` exercises HUD telemetry via Playwright using input press + `show()` fallback; `run_playwright.sh` script standardizes CI-friendly Playwright execution.
- **Documentation & backlog**: `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`, and `docs/plans/backlog.md` record the HUD telemetry workflow; MCP backlog `DEBUG-248` marked with completed HUD integration and new follow-ups.

## Verification
- `npm test -- SaveInspectorOverlay`
- `npm test -- ReputationUI`
- `npm test -- TutorialOverlay`
- `npm test -- tutorialViewModel`
- `./run_playwright.sh test tests/e2e/hud-telemetry.spec.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Export cascade timelines / tutorial snapshots for external QA tooling or CI artifact capture (remaining `DEBUG-248` follow-up).
2. Broaden Playwright coverage for additional user-facing overlays once cascade metadata appears in full scenes.
3. Continue monitoring dispatch benchmarks as telemetry consumers grow; no regression noted this session but remains a watch item.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Prototype telemetry export pipeline (CSV/JSON) leveraging `SaveManager.getInspectorSummary()` results.
- Add user-flow Playwright coverage validating cascade telemetry when integrated into narrative missions.
- Re-run state-store benchmarks after export tooling to ensure 0.25 ms budget holds.
