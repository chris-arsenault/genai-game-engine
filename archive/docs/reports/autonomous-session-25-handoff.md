# Autonomous Development Session #25 – Tutorial E2E Automation

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.18 hours (2025-10-28T12:15:00-07:00 – 2025-10-28T12:26:45-07:00)  
**Status**: Tutorial automation landed; QA-201 satisfied ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Delivered a Playwright regression (`tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`) that walks the tutorial system to completion, asserting store state, prompt history retention, and overlay visibility.
- Updated QA documentation with the new smoke coverage and logged backlog progress for QA-201, keeping the testing roadmap current.
- Confirmed that the dialogue, quest, and tutorial Playwright smokes all pass together, establishing a working triad for narrative QA.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Tutorial Playwright Coverage**: Implements automation that resets tutorial flags, drives step progression through the in-engine system, and validates completion markers in `WorldStateStore`.
- **Documentation Sync**: `docs/testing/TestStatus.md` now records the tutorial smoke and CI expectations remain aligned; `docs/plans/backlog.md` notes QA-201 completion.
- **Regression Confidence**: Full `npm run test:e2e` passes across all three narrative-focused specs, verifying no regressions from the new automation.

---

## Verification
- `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` ✅
- `npm run test:e2e` ✅

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **SaveManager LocalStorage regression (QA-202)** – Parity tests remain unresolved; prioritize test restoration to protect serialization changes.
2. **Transcript retention tuning (TOOL-045)** – Need benchmarks and enforced limits so expanded debug overlay remains performant during long sessions.
3. **LevelSpawnSystem perf spike (PERF-118)** – Capture spawn-loop telemetry to either optimize or rebaseline thresholds before re-enabling perf gates.
4. **Procedural guardrail monitoring (PERF-119)** – Log post-rebaseline telemetry for TileMap/SeededRandom to validate new limits.
5. **CI Playwright integration (CI-014)** – Wire the new smoke pack into pipelines with junit/artifact reporting for flake tracking.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Restore SaveManager LocalStorage parity tests (QA-202) and ensure CI captures the coverage.
2. Profile LevelSpawnSystem spawn loops (PERF-118) and align guardrails/alerts with PERF-119 monitoring.
3. Scope transcript retention tuning (TOOL-045) alongside CI Playwright onboarding (CI-014) to solidify tooling rollout.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 3 (`tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`, `docs/testing/TestStatus.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`)
- **Tests Added**: 1 Playwright tutorial smoke
- **Manual QA**: Visual overlay state observed via automation logs (tutorial prompts & completion)

---

## Notes
- Tutorial automation currently leverages `gameSystems.tutorial.completeStep()` to expedite coverage; future expansion could emit player actions to validate context-driven transitions if desired.
