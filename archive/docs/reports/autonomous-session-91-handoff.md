# Autonomous Development Session #91 - Branch Transition Handshake & Telemetry Inventory  
**Date**: November 6, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h00m  
**Status**: Act 2 branch selection now drives a coordinated checkpoint-to-scene handoff, and performance guardrail telemetry surfaces archive health directly in CI logs.

---

## Highlights
- Added `CrossroadsBranchTransitionController` to watch branch landing events, require checkpoint confirmation, and emit `scene:load:act2_thread` requests so the next quest thread can boot without bespoke glue.
- Wired `Game` to initialise the new controller, respond to `scene:load:act2_thread`, and stub `loadAct2ThreadScene` metadata updates while branch interiors are authored.
- Exposed `listHistoryEntries` inside `postPerformanceSummary.js`, logging recent archive files and extending Jest coverage to validate the history directory inventory.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/narrative/CrossroadsBranchTransitionController.js`  
- `src/game/Game.js` (branch transition wiring + scene loader stub)  
- `tests/game/narrative/CrossroadsBranchTransitionController.test.js`  
- `scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.js` (history logging + helper export)  
- `tests/scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.test.js` (history inventory coverage)  
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session 90–91 progress notes and status refresh)

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/narrative/CrossroadsBranchTransitionController.test.js tests/scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.test.js`
- `npm test`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Act 2 branch interiors** — `Game.loadAct2ThreadScene` currently records metadata and emits transition events but does not load a concrete scene; first branch interior still needs to consume the new request (`QUEST-610` follow-up).  
2. **Hub art/nav validation** — Await delivery of final Crossroads art/navigation meshes to validate collision and overlay placement against production geometry.  
3. **Telemetry CI smoke** — Need to observe the next CI run to confirm the new history inventory notice appears and that history counts remain stable before tightening thresholds (`PERF-119`).

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Implement the first branch-specific scene loader to handle `scene:load:act2_thread` payloads and transition the player out of the hub.  
- Integrate the updated art/nav package for the Crossroads hub and rerun navigation constraint tests.  
- Review the subsequent CI baseline summary to confirm the history inventory notice publishes and adjust guardrail documentation if needed.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated MCP backlog items `QUEST-610` and `PERF-119` with Session 91 progress, refreshed next steps, and noted new verification commands.  
- Reflected the same progress in `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Last Updated 2025-11-06).  
- Recorded an architecture decision: “Adopt CrossroadsBranchTransitionController to manage Act 2 branch transitions.”

---

## Metrics & Notes
- `CrossroadsBranchTransitionController` waits for both `crossroads:branch_landing_ready` and checkpoint entry, emitting `crossroads:branch_transition_ready` + `scene:load:act2_thread` once the branch quest closes.  
- `postPerformanceSummary.js` now logs up to five recent history files via `listHistoryEntries`, helping operators confirm archive retention directly from CI console output.
