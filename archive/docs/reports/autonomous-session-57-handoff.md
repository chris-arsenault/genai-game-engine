# Autonomous Development Session #57 – Tutorial Closure & Forensic Prompt Polish

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~70 m (Start ≈2025-10-29T08:34:00Z – End ≈2025-10-29T09:44:00Z)  
**Status**: Tutorial completion telemetry aligns with quest resolution; forensic interaction copy is player-facing; Playwright artifact policy is codified in config and CI.

---

## Executive Summary
- Patched `TutorialSystem` so the closing `case_solved` beat is recorded even when the quest finalizes the tutorial; added regression coverage.
- Humanised forensic prompt requirement strings (tools, skills, difficulty) and synced failure messaging, with dedicated unit tests for formatting.
- Centralised Playwright reporter + artifact retention configuration and refreshed CI/docs so failure traces/video persist automatically.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Tutorial resolution parity**: `TutorialSystem.completeTutorial` now backfills the last step and the `quest:completed` handler advances the final step before firing `tutorial:completed`, restoring in-game/store parity (`src/game/systems/TutorialSystem.js:227`, `src/game/systems/TutorialSystem.js:331`). Jest tests cover the quest completion edge case (`tests/game/systems/TutorialSystem.test.js:351`).
- **Forensic UX polish**: The forensic prompt formats tool/skill ids into readable labels with romanised difficulty tiers and consistent failure copy; helper methods added for reuse (`src/game/Game.js:1347`, `src/game/Game.js:1414`). New specs lock the formatted output (`tests/game/Game.forensicPrompts.test.js:45`).
- **CI artifact alignment**: Playwright config now emits `line+junit+html` reporters, retains screenshots/video/traces on failure, and exposes output paths via env overrides (`playwright.config.js:9`). GitHub Actions relies on the shared config (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:39`) and docs highlight the streamlined workflow (`docs/testing/TestStatus.md:354`). Tutorial automation guide documents the new prompt copy and final step parity (`docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md:21`).

---

## Verification
- `npm test` — 88 suites / 1,952 tests passing (Jest).
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` — 7 tutorial E2E scenarios passing headless Chromium.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Tool/skill label catalogue** — Current friendly labels live in the merged defaults exposed via `GameConfig.localization.forensic`; migrate to data-driven definitions once the tool progression table lands to avoid drift.
2. **MCP backlog sync** — Unable to update canonical backlog/items because `mcp__game-mcp-server` timed out. Mirror changes when the service is responsive.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Extend forensic prompt formatting to cover localisation hooks once narrative strings stabilise.
- Re-run backlog task updates in MCP (`Tutorial finalisation`, `QA-274 follow-up`) after connectivity is restored.

---

## Blockers
- `mcp__game-mcp-server` operations (handoff fetch/store, backlog updates) timed out throughout the session; noted and pending retry.
