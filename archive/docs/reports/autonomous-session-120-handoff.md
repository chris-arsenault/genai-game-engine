# Autonomous Development Session #120 – Entity Lifecycle Telemetry

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h 15m  
**Focus**: ECS destroy hooks, spatial hash instrumentation, and operational hand-offs.

---

## Summary
- Hooked `EntityManager` destroy events into `QuestManager` and `FactionManager`, ensuring NPC despawns immediately block dependent objectives and log faction member removals.
- Registered the collision system (metrics-only) and surfaced `SpatialHash.getMetrics()` alongside bucket/ops summaries in the debug overlay for stealth tuning.
- Completed operational follow-ups: shared the staged RenderOps packet, kicked off Week 1 of the bespoke art schedule, and circulated the telemetry reminder bundle with a tighter warning threshold.

---

## Deliverables
- **Engine / Gameplay**  
  - `src/engine/ecs/EntityManager.js`: capture component snapshots before removal, emit to listeners with error shields.  
  - `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js`: new `handleEntityDestroyed` path blocking NPC-driven objectives, plus state cleanup tweaks.  
  - `src/game/managers/FactionManager.js`: recent removal tracking + `faction:member_removed` emission and accessor.  
  - `src/game/Game.js`: register collision system (resolve disabled), bind entity destroy hooks, and expose payload builder.  
  - `src/main.js`, `index.html`: spatial hash overlay section, DOM bindings, and metrics rendering logic.  
  - `tests/*`: expanded coverage for destroy listeners, quest blocking, faction removal logging, and system registration expectations.
- **Operations & Assets**  
  - `deliveries/renderops/act2-crossroads/...`: handoff README/share manifest annotated with 2025-11-13 distribution notes.  
  - `reports/art/placeholder-replacement-schedule.md`, `assets/images/requests.json`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`: Week 1 bespoke kickoff recorded; affected manifests flagged `bespoke-scheduled`.  
  - `deliveries/telemetry/act2-crossroads-20251112/...`: share log + staging manifest updated, warning threshold lowered to 2 days.
- **Documentation & Planning**  
  - `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Session #120 updates captured, next-session focus refreshed.  
  - `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: noted destroy hook + spatial hash tooling additions.

## Verification
- `npm test` (full Jest suite) – PASS @ 2025-11-13 05:54 UTC (~27.5s).

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Add integration coverage confirming quest blockers clear once NPCs respawn and that faction removal telemetry feeds analytics dashboards (`M1-002` / `M1-012` next steps).  
2. Monitor RenderOps feedback for the two skipped Crossroads segments; regenerate overlays if adjustments land (`AR-050`).  
3. Track Week 1 bespoke art deliverables and record approvals/licensing in `assets/images/requests.json`.  
4. Watch for analytics acknowledgement of the 2025-11-13 telemetry reminder and adjust warning threshold again if stakeholders need additional lead time (`TEL-021`).

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `M1-002`, `M1-012`, `AR-050`, and `TEL-021` updated in MCP with new completed work and follow-up actions.  
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` now references the Week 1 kickoff and new manifest statuses.  
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` reflects collision metrics + destroy-hook work and revised operational focus.

---

## Notes
- Collision system now runs in metrics-only mode (`resolveCollisions: false`); keep an eye out for future requirements to enable resolution or prune per-scene registration.
- Spatial hash metrics currently reset per frame; consider rolling averages or thresholds if stealth tuning calls for longer-term analysis.
