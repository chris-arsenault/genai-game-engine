# Autonomous Development Session #139 – Detective Vision Audio & Perf Polish

**Date**: November 9, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 20m  
**Focus**: Profile the detective vision overlay and align its audio/FX feedback loop with the new HUD events.

---

## Summary
- Extended `scripts/telemetry/performanceSnapshot.js` to profile detective vision overlay update and render paths, capturing a fresh telemetry artifact that confirms a <0.03 ms combined frame cost.
- Enhanced `AudioFeedbackController` with detective vision activation/deactivation/insufficient-resource cues, including loop playback management for the trace ambience and new Jest coverage.
- Emitted `fx:overlay_cue` events (and contextual `fxCue` metadata on overlay visibility) from `DetectiveVisionOverlay`, unifying future VFX consumers and updating backlog/docs to reflect the completed polish pass.

---

## Deliverables
- `scripts/telemetry/performanceSnapshot.js`
- `telemetry-artifacts/performance/test-detective-vision.json`
- `src/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.js`
- `src/game/ui/DetectiveVisionOverlay.js`
- Tests: `tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/DetectiveVisionOverlay.test.js`
- Documentation: `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `node scripts/telemetry/performanceSnapshot.js --out telemetry-artifacts/performance/test-detective-vision.json`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js tests/game/ui/DetectiveVisionOverlay.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Wire the new `fx:overlay_cue` events into the eventual VFX/particle system once that layer is online so detective vision can drive screen treatments beyond the HUD.
2. Balance detective vision activation/deactivation levels against other ability cues during the next holistic audio mix review.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Marked MCP backlog item `M2-002: Detective Vision Ability` as completed with the new telemetry + audio polish notes, and mirrored the status/progress narrative in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

---

## Notes
- Detective vision telemetry metrics are now part of the performance snapshot output (`detectiveVisionUpdate`, `detectiveVisionRender`, `detectiveVisionCombined`) with thresholds of 0.6/0.75/1.0 ms respectively.
- `AudioFeedbackController` retains loop handles so deactivation or controller cleanup stops the ambient trace layer immediately, preventing leak-driven overlaps during rapid ability toggles.
- `DetectiveVisionOverlay` emits `fx:overlay_cue` with `effectId` `detectiveVisionActivation` / `detectiveVisionDeactivate`; consumer systems should subscribe instead of inferring from visibility toggles.
