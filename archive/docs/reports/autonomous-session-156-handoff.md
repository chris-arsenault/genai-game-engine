# Autonomous Development Session #156 – Save/Load Profiling & QA Prep

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 35m  
**Focus**: Validate Save/Load performance, harden manual slot UX during autosave churn, and prep telemetry/QA consumers with schema summaries.

## Summary
- Implemented SaveManager profiling utilities and telemetry scripts to capture save/load latency, confirming a 0.46 ms average load and 1.07 ms average save across five iterations of a representative world snapshot.
- Strengthened the Save/Load overlay to preserve manual slot selection when autosaves reorder entries, backed by new Jest coverage for autosave refresh scenarios.
- Generated save payload schema summaries for QA/telemetry ingest, exposing counts, equipped slots, and faction coverage to accelerate schema sign-off discussions.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/saveLoadProfiling.js`
- `src/game/managers/savePayloadSummary.js`
- `src/game/ui/SaveLoadOverlay.js`
- `tests/game/managers/saveLoadProfiling.test.js`
- `tests/game/managers/savePayloadSummary.test.js`
- `tests/game/ui/SaveLoadOverlay.test.js`
- `scripts/telemetry/profileSaveLoadLatency.js`
- `scripts/telemetry/exportSavePayloadSummary.js`
- `package.json`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- `docs/reports/autonomous-session-156-handoff.md`

## Verification
- `npm test`
- `npm run telemetry:profile-save-load`
- `npm run telemetry:save-payload-summary`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Distribute the profiling report and payload summary outputs to QA for schema sign-off; capture approvals or requested adjustments.
2. Investigate the SaveManager parity warnings between WorldStateStore snapshots and legacy collectors observed during profiling runs.
3. Schedule in-engine autosave stress passes to validate focus cues, FX emissions, and event sequencing beyond unit coverage.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated backlog item `M3-016` with profiling utilities, overlay UX hardening, QA tooling, and refreshed next steps.
- Logged Session #156 outcomes in `docs/plans/backlog.md`, including verification commands and tooling references.

## Notes
- Profiling script outputs include per-iteration samples; results for Session #156 are archived in this handoff for cross-team review.
- Save payload summary tooling defaults to a MemoryStorage stub—swap in platform storage when running inside the playable build to inspect live schema contents.
- SaveManager parity warnings flag tutorial/dialogue differences between world state snapshots and legacy collectors; follow-up item tracks reconciliation work.
