# Autonomous Development Session #23 – Dialogue Overlay QA Pass

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.43 hours (2025-10-28T11:14:25-07:00 – 2025-10-28T11:40:12-07:00)  
**Status**: Dialogue overlay smoke + debug hooks landed ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Brought Playwright infrastructure online under WSL2 by wiring `wslview` and strict host binding, then authored the first dialogue overlay smoke test exercising `WorldStateStore` selectors end-to-end.
- Exposed engine/game references on `window` to unblock automation harnesses and began surfacing dialogue state inside the in-game debug overlay for rapid branch validation.
- Updated testing and backlog documentation to reflect new E2E coverage and debug instrumentation progress.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **WSL2 Playwright Enablement**: Added `playwright.config.js` with `BROWSER=wslview` and `--host 127.0.0.1 --strictPort` to satisfy mixed host networking constraints.
- **Dialogue Overlay E2E Smoke**: `tests/e2e/dialogue-overlay.spec.js` validates dialogue visibility, choice selection, and transcript logging by driving `DialogueSystem` directly.
- **Debug Overlay Prototype**: HTML overlay now renders active dialogue metadata, live text, available choices, and the recent transcript using `buildDialogueViewModel`.
- **Documentation Sync**: `docs/testing/TestStatus.md` now tracks partial Playwright coverage; backlog entry for PO-003 records new progress and remaining quest automation work.

---

## Verification
- `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/dialogue-overlay.spec.js` ✅
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js` ✅ (post-UI wiring verification)

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Quest/Tutorial Playwright flows** – Extend E2E coverage beyond the dialogue smoke to quest milestones and tutorial prompts.
2. **Transcript storage tuning** – Monitor debug overlay performance; large transcripts may need truncation or pagination if sessions run long.
3. **CI Playwright adoption** – Ensure runners install browsers (`npx playwright install`) and honor WSL2-specific requirements before integrating into pipelines.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Build quest progression Playwright scenarios (objective updates, HUD assertions).
2. Harden dialogue debug overlay (timestamp formatting, scrolling, optional pause/resume controls).
3. Capture CI telemetry for the new E2E harness and adjust thresholds/timeouts as needed.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 7 (`playwright.config.js`, `tests/e2e/dialogue-overlay.spec.js`, `tests/e2e/setup.js`, `src/main.js`, `index.html`, `docs/testing/TestStatus.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`)
- **Tests Added**: 1 Playwright smoke suite
- **Manual QA**: Debug overlay verified via selector outputs (automated through test harness)

---

## Notes
- `window.engine`, `window.game`, and `window.worldStateStore` are now exposed for tooling; secure behind dev-only guard if production builds require lockdown.
- Playwright artifacts (`test-results/`) should stay git-ignored; clean workspace prior to commits.
