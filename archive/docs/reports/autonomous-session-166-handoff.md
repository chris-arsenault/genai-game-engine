# Autonomous Development Session #166 – Automation Follow-up Sweep

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~90m  
**Focus**: Close the remaining automation follow-ups for save/load asset sourcing, adaptive mix coverage, and RenderOps approval ingestion.

## Summary
- Re-routed `image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack` through GPT-Image-1 automation, updating manifests and visual inventory so the dash/slide sprite sheet now lives under internal generation workflows.
- Added AdaptiveMusicLayerController regression coverage that validates ambient/tension/combat mix weights against `GameConfig.audio` to guard AR-008 downtown stem integrations.
- Imported RenderOps feedback for the Crossroads lighting packet, marked telemetry job `c2d9170c-9d13-4e3b-941c-e1ee89d8bb68` complete, and logged approvals in the canonical feedback reports.

## Deliverables
- Generated asset: `assets/generated/images/ar-003/image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack.png` (transparent dash/slide sprite sheet).
- Test coverage: updates to `tests/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusicLayerController.test.js` for mix regression validation.
- Docs refreshed: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session #166 backlog notes).
- Telemetry & feedback artifacts: `reports/art/renderops-feedback.json`, `reports/art/renderops-feedback.md`, updated queue entry `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/act2-crossroads/2025-10-31T08:50:35.195Z-c2d9170c-9d13-4e3b-941c-e1ee89d8bb68.json`, and import payload `reports/art/renderops-feedback/act2-crossroads-2025-10-31-review.json`.

## Verification
- `npm test -- AdaptiveMusicLayerController`
- `npm test`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Integrate the generated dash/slide sprite sheet into the player animation set and refresh autosave overlay captures once new frames are hooked (M3-016).
2. Hook downtown adaptive stems into the district ambient controller and validate transitions with the new mix regression suite (AR-008).
3. Continue monitoring `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/` for new jobs, rerun `scripts/art/importRenderOpsFeedback.js`, and regenerate packets when future actionable segments appear (AR-050).

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- **M3-016**: Manifest status flipped to `ai-generated`, backlog next steps now focus on integrating the generated frames; visual inventory documents the reroute.
- **AR-008**: Mix regression coverage recorded in backlog notes with guidance to use GameConfig-derived expectations during future tuning.
- **AR-050**: Feedback import logged, telemetry job marked `completed`, and inventory notes capture the approval closure path.
