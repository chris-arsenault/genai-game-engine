# Autonomous Development Session #137 – Evidence Gating & Detective Vision Enablement

**Date**: November 7, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h 10m  
**Focus**: Expose evidence dependency metadata, gate clue breadcrumbs behind abilities, and extend investigation coverage.

---

## Summary
- Extended `EvidenceGraph` with dependency accessors so procedural systems can inspect prerequisites without rehydrating raw graphs.
- Updated `EntityPopulator` to mark clue/analysis evidence as hidden and assign ability requirements (`detective_vision`, `forensic_analysis`) derived from dependency metadata.
- Hardened investigation coverage with new Jest suites validating hidden gating in spawn data and integration flows, keeping detective vision and ability unlock behavior green.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/procedural/EvidenceGraph.js`, `tests/game/procedural/EvidenceGraph.test.js`
- `src/game/procedural/EntityPopulator.js`, `tests/game/procedural/EntityPopulator.test.js`
- `tests/game/integration/investigation-integration.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/procedural/EvidenceGraph.test.js tests/game/procedural/EntityPopulator.test.js tests/game/integration/investigation-integration.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Implement detective vision visual overlay and cooldown/energy tuning to fulfil the remaining M2-002 acceptance criteria.
2. Profile the updated investigation loop once the overlay lands to confirm hidden evidence gating stays under the 1 ms frame budget.
3. Extend spawn data to carry derived clue IDs once procedural evidence authoring matures, keeping CaseManager telemetry aligned.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- MCP backlog item `M2-002: Detective Vision Ability` marked **in-progress** with new procedural gating work logged and next steps queued.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the new progress note so markdown stays aligned with MCP.

---

## Notes
- Procedural gating heuristics: `RevealType.CLUE` defaults to `detective_vision`, `RevealType.ANALYSIS` maps to `forensic_analysis`, with metadata overrides supported via `requiresAbility`.
- EntityPopulator now normalizes string/array ability requirements to guard against malformed upstream data before spawn creation.
