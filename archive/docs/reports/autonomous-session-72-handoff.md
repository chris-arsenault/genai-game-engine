# Autonomous Development Session #72 – Provider Metrics Dashboards & Transcript Sequencing
**Date**: November 2, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h05m  
**Status**: CI workflows now surface telemetry upload metrics inline, and cascade mission automation verifies tutorial transcript sequencing alongside cascade exports.

---

## Highlights
- Added `scripts/telemetry/reportProviderMetrics.js` plus Jest coverage to summarise persisted `providerResults` and append upload metrics to GitHub Step Summaries (status, exit code, duration, artifact).
- Wired the new reporter into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, ensuring dashboards immediately reflect GitHub CLI successes/skips/failures after telemetry export.
- Deepened `tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js` to assert tutorial transcript ordering, step coverage, and transcript artifact presence in cascade mission exports.
- Refreshed `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` and `docs/plans/backlog.md` with telemetry dashboard guidance and latest PO-002 progress; MCP backlog item updated with new completed work and remaining next steps.

---

## Deliverables
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` – Added “Summarize telemetry provider metrics” step invoking the reporter after export.
- `scripts/telemetry/reportProviderMetrics.js` – CLI/utility for parsing `ci-artifacts.json` provider results and emitting markdown summaries (with exports for reuse).
- `tests/integration/providerMetricsReporter.test.js` – Jest suite covering aggregation, markdown formatting, CLI execution, and missing-manifest handling.
- `tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js` – Extended assertions for transcript sequencing, prompt coverage, and transcript artifact verification.
- `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` / `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Documentation and backlog progress notes reflecting CI summary instrumentation and transcript sequencing coverage.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/integration/providerMetricsReporter.test.js`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js --reporter=list --timeout=60000`

Both suites passed.

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Monitor GitHub CLI availability in CI runners and design a fallback upload orchestration path if the CLI becomes unavailable (tracked on PO-002).
2. Continue watching provider metrics in job summaries to confirm telemetry uploads stay stable under multiple artifact combinations.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Prototype the GitHub CLI fallback (e.g., REST upload or skip classification) so telemetry exports stay resilient if runners lose `gh`.
- Review PO-002 acceptance criteria for closure once CLI fallback lands and verify benchmarks remain under guardrails.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- MCP backlog item `PO-002` updated: added completed work entries for CI summary metrics + transcript sequencing assertions; next steps narrowed to GitHub CLI fallback monitoring.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` progress log mirrors the new instrumentation milestone.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- CI summary now reports provider status counts and exit codes per run, enabling faster detection of telemetry upload regressions.
- Cascade mission telemetry exports deliver ≥5 artifacts per run (JSON + cascade CSV + tutorial snapshots + transcript CSV/MD) with transcript sequences validated by automation.
