const attitude = this.factionManager.getFactionAttitude('vanguard_prime');
const standings = this.factionManager.getAllStandings();
```

**Cascading Reputation Example:**
```
Player helps Vanguard Prime: +20 fame
→ Luminari Syndicate (ally): +10 fame, -10 infamy
→ Wraith Network (enemy): -10 fame, +10 infamy
```

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Event-Driven Tutorial Integration

**Context**: Tutorial System needs to track player progress without tight coupling to game systems

**Options Considered:**
1. Direct system method calls (tight coupling)
2. Polling-based condition checks (inefficient)
3. Event-driven subscription (loose coupling)

**Decision**: Event-driven subscription via EventBus

**Rationale:**
- Maintains loose coupling between systems
- Easy to add new tutorial steps without modifying existing systems
- Efficient (only checks when relevant events occur)
- Follows existing architectural patterns
- Enables easy testing with mock events

**Impact**: Tutorial system can evolve independently, new steps can be added by defining conditions and events

---

### Decision 2: Centralized Faction Management

**Context**: Multiple systems need faction reputation data (dialogue, combat, quests, progression)

**Options Considered:**
1. Distributed state in each system
2. Component-based reputation (FactionMember component)
3. Centralized manager (FactionManager)

**Decision**: Centralized FactionManager

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth eliminates inconsistencies
- Cascading logic in one place, easy to maintain
- Save/load simplified (one place to serialize)
- Event-driven updates keep UI in sync
- Easier debugging and testing

**Impact**: All systems delegate faction operations to FactionManager, reputation logic centralized and consistent

---

### Decision 3: Comprehensive Test Coverage First

**Context**: Session #5 delivered implementations without tests

**Options Considered:**
1. Defer testing to later sprint
2. Write minimal smoke tests
3. Comprehensive test suites immediately

**Decision**: Comprehensive test suites immediately after integration

**Rationale:**
- Catch integration issues early
- Validate complex logic (cascading, attitude calculation)
- Document expected behavior for future developers
- Increase confidence in production readiness
- Meet coverage targets early

**Impact**: 182 tests created, 86.58% coverage achieved, high confidence in system correctness

---

## 🚀 Recommendations for Next Session

   - Attitude indicators (hostile/friendly/etc.)
   - Tooltips explaining consequences

2. **M3-005: NPC Memory System** (3 hours)
   - NPCs remember player actions
   - Recognition mechanics (distance, line of sight)
   - Memory persistence across sessions
   - Faction-based information sharing

3. **M3-006: Disguise System** (4 hours)
   - Equip faction disguises
   - Detection rolls based on effectiveness
   - Known NPCs see through disguises
   - Suspicious actions increase detection

4. **M3-020: Testing and Polish** (2 hours)
   - Integration testing for full faction pipeline
   - Balance tuning for disguise effectiveness
   - Bug fixes
   - Documentation updates

**Outcome**: Sprint 3 at 100%, ready to begin Sprint 4 (Procedural Generation)

---

### Option B: Begin Sprint 4 (Procedural Generation)

**Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours

**Tasks:**
1. **M4-001: District Layout Generation** (4 hours)
   - BSP-based district generation

   - Pathfinding and connectivity

2. **M4-002: Case Generation System** (6 hours)
   - Case templates (murder, theft, conspiracy)
   - Evidence placement algorithms
   - Witness/suspect pools
   - Quality validation

**Outcome**: Procedural generation foundation established

---

### Option C: Polish and Quality Pass (Lower Priority)

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**Tasks:**
1. Fix remaining test mock issues (37 failing tests)
2. Performance profiling and optimization
3. Code quality pass (linting, refactoring)
4. Documentation updates

**Outcome**: Higher test pass rate, improved code quality

---

**My Recommendation**: **Option A** - Complete Sprint 3

**Rationale:**
- Sprint 3 is at 85%, finish it before moving to Sprint 4
- Faction system needs UI and disguise mechanics to be fully playable
- NPC memory and disguise systems are critical for social gameplay
- Completing Sprint 3 creates clean milestone for vertical slice demo
- Sprint 4 (procedural generation) is a large undertaking, better to start fresh

## 🎓 Key Learnings from Session #6

### Integration Timing

**Learning**: Integrating systems immediately after implementation reveals issues early

**Impact**: Found and fixed several event emission issues during integration that would have been harder to debug later

**Recommendation**: Continue pattern of implement → integrate → test in rapid cycles

---

### Comprehensive Testing Value

**Learning**: Writing comprehensive tests (182 tests) immediately after integration provides high confidence

**Impact**:
- Discovered edge cases in TutorialSystem (step progression when skipped)
- Validated FactionManager cascading logic thoroughly
- Documented expected behavior for future developers
- Achieved 86.58% coverage exceeding targets

**Recommendation**: Maintain high testing standards, especially for complex systems

---

### Centralized Managers Scale Better

**Learning**: FactionManager pattern (centralized state + event-driven) scales much better than distributed component-based state

**Impact**:
- Eliminated inconsistencies between systems
- Simplified save/load (one place to serialize)
- Made debugging easier (single source of truth)
- Enabled easy feature additions (new factions just add data)

**Recommendation**: Apply centralized manager pattern to other complex systems (QuestManager, ProgressionManager)

---

### Event-Driven Architecture Wins

**Learning**: Event-driven integration (EventBus subscriptions) creates loose coupling and maintainability

**Impact**:
- Tutorial system doesn't depend on specific system implementations
- Easy to add new tutorial steps without modifying existing systems
- Testing simplified with mock events
- Systems can evolve independently

**Recommendation**: Continue using EventBus for system communication, avoid direct method calls

- Tutorial uses text overlays (no art needed)
- Faction system uses data structures (no art needed)
- Sufficient for development, testing, and vertical slice validation
- Assets only needed for visual polish and final release
