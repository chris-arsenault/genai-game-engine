# Autonomous Development Session #61 – WorldStateStore Observability Instrumentation

**Date**: October 30, 2025  \
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  \
**Session Duration**: ~1h20m (Start ≈2025-10-30T09:05:00-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-30T10:25:00-07:00)  \
**Status**: WorldStateStore now surfaces blocked quest objectives, faction resets, and inventory selections with fresh slice selectors and regression coverage.

---

## Executive Summary
- Extended `WorldStateStore` instrumentation to capture `objective:blocked`, `faction:reputation_reset`, and `inventory:selection_changed` events, enriching QA visibility into narrative gating and world telemetry.
- Augmented quest, faction, and inventory slices plus selectors to expose blocked objective metadata, reset provenance, and inventory focus—unlocking new debug overlay/SaveManager insights.
- Added focused Jest suites for the updated slices and store, then re-ran the full Jest battery and a short Vite dev-server smoke to guard against regressions.
- Created MCP backlog item `PO-002` (now canonical) and mirrored progress in `docs/plans/backlog.md` for ongoing observability milestones.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Event instrumentation**: `src/game/state/WorldStateStore.js` now dispatches enriched actions for blocked objectives, faction reputation resets, and inventory selection changes, keeping action history and listeners in sync.
- **Quest slice telemetry**: `src/game/state/slices/questSlice.js` tracks blocked objectives (reason, requirement, timestamp) with new selectors (`selectQuestBlockedObjectives`, `selectBlockedObjectives`, etc.) for HUD/debug consumers.
- **Faction slice resilience**: `src/game/state/slices/factionSlice.js` resets cleanly on `faction:reputation_reset`, recording initiator + reason for downstream tooling via `selectFactionLastReset`.
- **Inventory selection logging**: `src/game/state/slices/inventorySlice.js` stores the active selection, last selection time, and source with resilient selectors consumable from both slice/root contexts.
- **Regression coverage**: Added/expanded Jest suites (`tests/game/state/worldStateStore.test.js`, `tests/game/state/slices/{questSlice,factionSlice}.test.js`, `tests/game/state/inventorySlice.test.js`) to lock the new behaviour.
- **Backlog alignment**: Captured PO-002 details in MCP (`id: 834c4f4d-fbf5-4227-b497-01114d85f5aa`) and echoed progress in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

## Verification
- `npm test -- questSlice`
- `npm test -- factionSlice`
- `npm test -- inventorySlice`
- `npm test -- worldStateStore`
- `npm test`
- `timeout 5 npm run dev -- --host`

_All Jest suites green; dev server booted without console errors before manual timeout._

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Update `benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js` to exercise production reducers and validate dispatch latency (<0.25 ms) with the new telemetry paths.
2. Extend PO-002 to capture additional observability (e.g., faction cascade metadata, tutorial prompt history snapshots) and surface the data in debug overlays.
3. Document the new selectors/debug hooks in developer + QA guides (`docs/tech/world-state-store.md` / overlay docs) to ensure teams adopt the enriched telemetry.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Refresh the state-store benchmark harness and add guardrails for the expanded slices.
- Wire remaining instrumentation for faction cascade telemetry and tutorial prompt history, then expose in debug HUD tooling.
- Update documentation/playbooks so QA and narrative teams can leverage blocked-objective and selection data during smokes.

## Artifact Locations
- Store instrumentation: `src/game/state/WorldStateStore.js`
- Slice updates: `src/game/state/slices/{questSlice,factionSlice,inventorySlice}.js`
- Regression suites: `tests/game/state/{worldStateStore.test.js,slices/questSlice.test.js,slices/factionSlice.test.js,inventorySlice.test.js}`
- Backlog/documentation: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (PO-002 progress), MCP backlog item `834c4f4d-fbf5-4227-b497-01114d85f5aa`
