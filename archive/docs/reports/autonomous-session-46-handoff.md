# Autonomous Development Session #46 – Audio Foundation & CI Artifacts

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h05m (Start 2025-10-31T09:10:00-07:00 – End 2025-10-31T11:15:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Engine audio subsystem online, Memory Parlor ambience integrated, CI publishes Playwright HTML/traces.

---

## Executive Summary
- Replaced the stubbed AudioManager with a Web Audio implementation featuring buffer caching, pooled SFX playback, and a music channel abstraction—complete with unit coverage.
- Introduced an AmbientSceneAudioController that reacts to scrambler events, loads the sourced “Goodnightmare” ambient track, and injects it into Memory Parlor scene metadata for cleanup.
- Extended GitHub Actions to emit Playwright HTML reports and compressed traces, aligning local and CI smoke results.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **AudioManager implementation**: Added `AudioManager`, `MusicChannel`, and `SFXPool` production code plus Jest suites to exercise initialization, buffer loading, fade automation, and pooling (`src/engine/audio/*.js`, `tests/engine/audio/*.test.js`).
- **Memory Parlor ambience**: Ambient controller listens to `firewall:scrambler_*` events, boosts volume during scrambler windows, and disposes on scene teardown while exposing tunables through `GameConfig` (`src/game/audio/AmbientSceneAudioController.js`, `src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js`, `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`).
- **Asset integration**: Downloaded FreePD “Goodnightmare” loop, registered it in the manifest/backlog, and documented usage for Memory Parlor infiltration (`assets/music/memory-parlor/goodnightmare.mp3`, `assets/music/requests.json`, `assets/manifest.example.json`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`).
- **CI artifacts**: Playwright step now runs with `line,junit,html` reporters, compresses the HTML report, and uploads traces for flake triage (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- **Documentation**: Authored `docs/plans/audio-system-plan.md` detailing architecture phases, data flow, and testing strategies for the audio stack; updated changelog/backlog entries.

## Verification
- `npm test` – Full suite (passes locally with intermittent performance assertions; reran targeted suites to confirm stability).
- `npx jest tests/engine/audio/AudioManager.test.js` – ✅
- `npx jest tests/engine/audio/MusicChannel.test.js` – ✅
- `npx jest tests/engine/audio/SFXPool.test.js` – ✅
- `npx jest tests/game/audio/AmbientSceneAudioController.test.js` – ✅
- `npx jest tests/engine/physics/integration.test.js` & `npx jest tests/game/procedural/TileMap.test.js` – ✅ (post-flake confirmation)
- `npx jest tests/game/systems/ForensicSystem.test.js` – ✅ (performance flake cleared)
- `npx playwright test --reporter=line,html --output=test-results` – ✅ (generates HTML + traces)

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Adaptive layering**: MusicChannel currently handles a single stream; adaptive mood layering remains to be implemented (per audio plan Phase 2).
2. **SFX asset catalog**: AudioManager expects decoded buffers; need to source & register UI/gameplay SFX, plus extend AssetManager integration.
3. **Ambient coverage beyond Memory Parlor**: Additional scenes require ambient controllers or hooks once bespoke tracks are sourced.
4. **Performance flake monitoring**: Physics/Forensic performance tests occasionally breach thresholds under load—monitor CI artifacts post-change.
5. **CI artifact retention**: Validate artifact retention window meets QA needs; consider job summary links once GitHub Actions stabilises.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Implement adaptive music layering (Ambient + Tension + Combat) atop MusicChannel with state transitions tied to Disguise/Combat events.
2. Source and integrate core UI/Game SFX, wiring AssetManager to AudioManager for declarative preload.
3. Add Playwright job summary step linking to HTML report/traces for quicker triage.
4. Profile ambient controller under repeated scrambler toggles; adjust fade timings or pooling limits as needed.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 18 (engine audio, game scenes/config, CI workflow, docs, assets)
- **Tests Added**: 4 Jest suites (audio engine + ambient controller)
- **Assets Added**: `assets/music/memory-parlor/goodnightmare.mp3` (FreePD, CC0)
- **Plans/Docs**: `docs/plans/audio-system-plan.md`, changelog & backlog updates

## Asset Sourcing Notes
- **music-memory-parlor-ambient-001**: “Goodnightmare” by Kevin MacLeod – FreePD (CC0/Public Domain). Stored at `/music/memory-parlor/goodnightmare.mp3`. Documented loop points (~232s) and integration status in `assets/music/requests.json`.
