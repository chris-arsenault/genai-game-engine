# Autonomous Development Session #138 – Detective Vision HUD Finalization

**Date**: November 8, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 45m  
**Focus**: Ship the detective vision player overlay, ability energy/cooldown tuning, and derived clue propagation.

---

## Summary
- Delivered a canvas-based `DetectiveVisionOverlay` that pulses hidden-evidence highlights, exposes real-time energy/cooldown gauges, and respects dynamic control bindings.
- Extended `InvestigationSystem` with a proper energy pool, regeneration, and status broadcast pipeline, wiring the input toggle from `Game` and emitting `detective_vision:status` snapshots for HUD/telemetry consumers.
- Propagated derived clue identifiers through procedural spawn data, ensuring case playback and telemetry retain clue attribution while expanding Jest coverage for ECS evidence flows.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/DetectiveVisionOverlay.js`
- `src/game/Game.js` (overlay lifecycle + input wiring)
- `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js` (energy/cooldown, status events)
- `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`
- `src/game/procedural/EntityPopulator.js`
- Tests: `tests/game/ui/DetectiveVisionOverlay.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/procedural/EntityPopulator.test.js`
- Backlog doc: `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js tests/game/procedural/EntityPopulator.test.js tests/game/ui/DetectiveVisionOverlay.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Profile the detective vision scan/update loop (with overlay active) to confirm sub-1 ms frame cost and capture telemetry snapshots for Sprint 8 perf tracking.
2. Align detective vision audio/FX cues with the new HUD activation/deactivation events so ability feedback remains cohesive.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- MCP backlog item `M2-002: Detective Vision Ability` updated with new completed work, refreshed next steps, and matching progress note mirrored in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

---

## Notes
- New event payload: `detective_vision:status` supplies `active`, `energy`, `energyMax`, `cooldown`, `cooldownMax`, `cooldownRatio`, and `canActivate`. Consumers should prefer this stream over ad-hoc polling.
- Manual toggle now emits `ability:insufficient_resource` when energy is below the activation floor—UI/audio hooks can surface feedback without special-casing cooldown.
