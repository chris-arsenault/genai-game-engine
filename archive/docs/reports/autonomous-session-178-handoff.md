# Autonomous Development Session #178 – Faction Reputation Baselines

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~40m  
**Focus**: Close M3-001 by wiring faction-supplied reputation baselines into the runtime and extend validation coverage.

## Summary
- Added narrative-aligned `initialReputation` baselines to all five faction data modules and documented the update in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- Reworked `FactionManager.initializeReputation()` to seed fame/infamy from faction data (with clamping) so campaign openings reflect lore relationships.
- Expanded Jest suites for faction data and `FactionManager` to enforce the new schema and baseline expectations; marked M3-001 as `done` in the MCP backlog.
- Logged a blocker for M3-016: the generated dash/slide atlas (`image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack`) needs normalization before it can replace the placeholder frames.

## Deliverables
- Faction data updates: `src/game/data/factions/*.js` now expose `initialReputation` baselines matching narrative hooks.
- Runtime integration: `src/game/managers/FactionManager.js` consumes the new baselines while preserving cascade mechanics.
- Test coverage: `tests/game/data/factions/factions.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/FactionManager.test.js` updated to validate schema + initialization logic.
- Documentation refresh: `docs/plans/backlog.md` now reflects the completed M3-001 workstream and records the dash/slide atlas alignment dependency.

## Verification
```bash
npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/data/factions/factions.test.js tests/game/managers/FactionManager.test.js
```

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Normalize `assets/generated/images/ar-003/image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack.png` into consistent directional rows before swapping it into the player animation set (M3-016 next step).
2. Regenerate autosave overlay captures once the dash/slide atlas is aligned with the runtime sheet.
3. Monitor faction reputation cascades during narrative playtests to ensure the new baselines keep Act 1 beats balanced.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `M3-001: Faction Data Definitions` → `done` with notes/tests in MCP backlog.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` synchronized with current faction modules and notes the dash/slide atlas blocker under M3-016.
