# Autonomous Development Session #122 – HUD Telemetry QA & Bespoke Revisions

**Date**: November 15, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h 05m  
**Focus**: Playwright coverage for spatial hash telemetry, stealth profiling, and Week 1 bespoke art revisions.

---

## Summary
- Authored a Playwright scenario (`tests/e2e/debug-overlay-spatial-metrics.spec.js`) that exercises the debug HUD’s spatial hash metrics across window adjustments to guard against respawn/overlay regressions.
- Built `scripts/telemetry/profileSpatialHashWindows.js` plus `reports/telemetry/spatial-hash-window-profile.(json|md)` to benchmark retention windows, payload size, and per-frame cost for stealth encounters.
- Logged Week 1 bespoke updates (glow loop revision, neon district polish) via the bespoke tracking CLI, refreshing manifests, docs, and progress reports with licensing + review metadata.

---

## Deliverables
- **Engine / Telemetry**
  - `tests/e2e/debug-overlay-spatial-metrics.spec.js`: New Playwright coverage validating rolling averages, sample counts, and window signatures in the debug HUD.
  - `scripts/telemetry/profileSpatialHashWindows.js`: Profiling harness simulating stealth density across configurable windows while sampling timing/payload impact.
  - `reports/telemetry/spatial-hash-window-profile.json`, `reports/telemetry/spatial-hash-window-profile.md`: Retention vs payload analysis (60/90/120/180-frame windows) with recommended next steps.
- **Operations & Assets**
  - `reports/art/bespoke-week1-tracking.json`, `reports/art/week1-bespoke-progress.json`: Week 1 tracking payload updated with glow loop approval + neon signage review state.
  - `assets/images/requests.json`, `assets/bespoke/week1/README.md`: Manifest + README reflect new approvals, licensing notes, and deliverable paths for revised bespoke assets.
  - `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`: Session 122 notes capture profiling linkage and refreshed week-one status summary.
- **Planning**
  - `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Session 122 backlog entries for M1-002/M1-012 (telemetry coverage + profiling) and AR-050 (bespoke tracking refresh).

---

## Verification
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/debug-overlay-spatial-metrics.spec.js`
- `npm test` (full Jest suite)

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Review `reports/telemetry/spatial-hash-window-profile.md` to decide whether the 120-frame default should shift and plan telemetry exporter integration for rolling samples (`M1-012`).
2. Hook spatial hash HUD assertions into the infiltration Playwright fixture once stealth patrol scripting is ready (`M1-002`).
3. Gather RenderOps + narrative approval on the neon signage glow pass, then update bespoke tracking once cleared (`AR-050`).

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `M1-002`, `M1-012`, and `AR-050` updated in MCP with new completed work, refreshed next steps, and tied artifacts.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` and `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` now reference the profiling outputs and revised Week 1 bespoke state.
- Research cache `spatial-hash-window-profile` records profiling results for future stealth tuning sessions.

---

## Notes
- Profiling shows per-sample payload ~82 bytes; 120-frame retention (~9.8 KB) balances 2 s history with <0.006 ms `getMetrics` overhead, while 180 frames raises payload ~50% for marginal gains.
- `scripts/art/trackBespokeDeliverables.js --week=1` remains the source of truth for bespoke updates—edit `reports/art/bespoke-week1-tracking.json` before rerunning to keep audit trails consistent.
