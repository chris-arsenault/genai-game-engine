# Autonomous Development Session #163 – Backlog Hygiene & Asset Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Triage backlog items, document outstanding work, and remove stray assets without generating new content.

## Summary
- Reviewed high-priority backlog items; no stories met closure criteria because outstanding validation and art production tasks remain.
- Updated AR-008 to record the ambient layer integration and added explicit next steps for sourcing tension/combat tracks and adaptive mix checks.
- Added concrete follow-up actions to CORE-302 so the movement feedback loop work has a clear verification path.
- Removed the untracked `assets/generated/ar-007/image-ar-007-screen-effects-pack.png` file to avoid implying the screen-effects overlays are finished.

## Deliverables
- Backlog updates via MCP: `AR-008: Adaptive Music Tracks (M7)`, `CORE-302: Player Feedback & Movement Loop`.
- Documentation refresh: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (status narratives for AR-008 and CORE-302).
- Asset cleanup: Pruned stray `image-ar-007-screen-effects-pack.png` from `assets/generated/ar-007/`.

## Verification
- No automated suites executed (documentation/backlog-only changes).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Email the QA distribution list with the staged save/load delivery contents and capture receipt in `deliveries/qa/save-load/.../qa-feedback-tracker.md`.
2. Record schema validation feedback from QA in the tracker and mirror any required adjustments back into backlog item M3-016.
3. Coordinate with the bespoke art scheduler to slot production time for `image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack` now that it is routed away from OpenAI generation.
4. Design and generate `image-ar-007-screen-effects-pack` overlays to complete the AR-007 bundle.
5. Integrate the new particle sheets into the VFX pipeline and validate additive blending/performance at 60 FPS before locking art.
6. Source or commission AR-008 tension and combat layers, capture licensing metadata, and validate seamless adaptive transitions once tracks are staged.
7. Execute the CORE-302 audio cue audit and movement HUD/Playwright checks, then document camera smoothing parameters for CORE-303 planning.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- **AR-008: Adaptive Music Tracks (M7)** – Logged ambient loop completion, enumerated sourcing/licensing/validation next steps, and synced notes across MCP + backlog doc.
- **CORE-302: Player Feedback & Movement Loop** – Added action-oriented next steps (audio cue audit, regression checks, camera config docs) to reflect the remaining work.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the refreshed status language for both items.

## Assets & Media
- Deleted the stray `image-ar-007-screen-effects-pack.png` placeholder so asset directories only contain approved/generated deliverables. Screen-effects overlays remain outstanding per AR-007 next steps.
