# Autonomous Development Session #21 – DialogueBox HUD Integration

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.16 hours (2025-10-28T10:17:50-07:00 – 2025-10-28T10:27:17-07:00)  
**Status**: DialogueBox wired into HUD, store-driven input verified ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Instantiated `DialogueBox` inside `Game.initializeUIOverlays`, including keyboard forwarding and HUD rendering order adjustments.
- Ensured `DialogueBox` leverages the existing `WorldStateStore` subscription path so active dialogue state reflects on-screen without direct event listeners.
- Added focused Jest coverage (`Game.uiOverlays.test.js`) exercising the new wiring using a real `WorldStateStore` instance and verifying `dialogue:advance_requested` emission.
- Updated backlog entry PO-003 with the new HUD integration milestone.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Gameplay Coordination**: `Game` now holds `dialogueBox` reference, updates it each frame (typewriter timing scales to ms) and renders it between HUD and tutorial overlays (`src/game/Game.js`).
- **Input Handling**: Window keydown events map to `DialogueBox.handleInput`, ensuring keyboard choices/advance requests emit back through the shared EventBus (`src/game/Game.js`).
- **Regression Coverage**: New unit test verifies store-driven visibility, advance input emission, and clean cleanup path (`tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`).
- **Backlog Sync**: `docs/plans/backlog.md` PO-003 progress note reflects HUD wiring completion.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js` ✅

_(Full suite not re-run; prior failures in `tests/game/procedural/TileMap.test.js` and `tests/engine/procedural/SeededRandom.test.js` remain open from Session #20.)_

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Playwright selectors + HUD assertions** – Need E2E coverage that exercises the dialogue overlay via `WorldStateStore` selectors.
2. **Dialogue debug overlay** – Plan still calls for transcript/debug panel binding; not yet implemented.
3. **Perf suite flakiness** – Procedural generation tests continue to exceed perf baselines; requires threshold review or dedicated perf gating.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Expand Playwright smoke to validate dialogue/tutorial overlays against store selectors.
2. Implement dialogue debug overlay panel leveraging transcript data.
3. Rebaseline or isolate procedural perf benchmarks to unblock CI.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 3 (`src/game/Game.js`, `tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`)
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 1 targeted Jest suite (store-driven HUD wiring).
- **Benchmarks**: Not run this session (store integration unchanged).

---

## Notes
- Typewriter timing now receives `deltaTime * 1000` inside the game loop to respect millisecond-based speed tuning.
- Keyboard forwarding currently binds globally via `window`; future debug overlays may centralize input routing once UI manager refactor lands.
