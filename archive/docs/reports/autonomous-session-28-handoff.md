# Autonomous Development Session #28 – Act 1 Scene Dressing

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2.20 hours (2025-10-28T14:10:00-07:00 – 2025-10-28T16:22:00-07:00)  
**Status**: CORE-301 scene dressing implemented; renderer tests realigned ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Layered the Act 1 crime scene with ground decal, caution tape, and ambient props so the investigative space communicates context immediately on load.
- Tuned the crime scene trigger overlay to stay centered with the camera while softening the color wash for better readability against the neon grid background.
- Updated the renderer unit suite to reflect the expanded layer stack, keeping regression coverage aligned with the engine changes from Sessions #26–27.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Scene Set Dressing**: `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js` now builds ground and environment layer entities (crime scene plate, caution stripes, evidence markers, ambient props) using shared constants so the layout stays aligned as the camera pans.
- **Renderer Test Alignment**: `tests/engine/renderer/LayeredRenderer.test.js` expectations match the seven-layer stack (background → ui), preventing false negatives after the renderer refactor.
- **Backlog Signal**: `docs/plans/backlog.md` marks `CORE-301` as in progress with a pending browser smoke, clarifying remaining validation for the scene bring-up.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/engine/renderer/LayeredRenderer.test.js`

Manual browser validation is still outstanding to confirm palette balance and collision-free navigation around the new set dressing.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Browser Smoke** – Need to load the build locally to confirm layering, alpha values, and interaction zones around new props (risk: misaligned visuals or obstructive collisions).
2. **CORE-302** – Player feedback pass (movement easing, prompts, audio) remains untouched; still blocks the interactive slice UX.
3. **CORE-303** – Investigative loop skeleton pending; dependent on validated CORE-301/302 work.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Run in-browser smoke test, adjust palettes/positions if any sprites occlude gameplay cues.
2. Implement CORE-302 movement/interaction feedback so WASD/E actions have immediate response.
3. Begin wiring CORE-303 evidence progression and witness dialogue hooks once CORE-302 is stable.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 3 (`src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`, `tests/engine/renderer/LayeredRenderer.test.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`)
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 1 suite updated (renderer layers)
- **Automated Tests Run**: `tests/engine/renderer/LayeredRenderer.test.js`
- **Manual QA**: Pending (browser smoke still required)

---

## Notes
- New ambient props are visual-only for now; no colliders were attached to avoid accidental movement blockers until we confirm desired traversal paths.
- Crime scene marker coordinates intentionally align with the evidence spawn positions to reinforce investigative hotspots once interaction prompts arrive in CORE-302.
