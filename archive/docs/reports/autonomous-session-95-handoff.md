# Autonomous Development Session #95 - Act 2 Branch Deepening  
**Date**: November 10, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h05m  
**Status**: All three Act 2 interiors now deliver multi-step objectives with shared telemetry coverage; Crossroads art drop remains outstanding.

---

## Highlights
- Extended the personal investigation quest/scene with projection analysis and broadcast beats, wiring new triggers, navigation nodes, and analytics metadata.
- Deepened NeuroSync infiltration and Archivist alliance threads with encryption/exfiltration and coordination/signal objectives, mirroring geometry + navigation payloads across branches.
- Introduced `QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge` to emit normalized `telemetry:trigger_entered/exited` events for every quest trigger (scene suites updated to cover the new beats).

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/data/quests/act2PersonalInvestigationQuest.js`, `act2NeuroSyncQuest.js`, `act2ResistanceQuest.js`
- `src/game/scenes/Act2PersonalInvestigationScene.js`, `Act2CorporateInfiltrationScene.js`, `Act2ResistanceHideoutScene.js`
- `src/game/telemetry/QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge.js`, `src/game/Game.js`
- `tests/game/scenes/Act2*Scene.test.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge.test.js`
- `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2PersonalInvestigationScene.test.js tests/game/scenes/Act2CorporateInfiltrationScene.test.js tests/game/scenes/Act2ResistanceHideoutScene.test.js tests/game/telemetry/QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge.test.js`
  - Confirms quest/trigger wiring, navigation metadata, and telemetry bridge emissions across all Act 2 branches.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Crossroads art/navigation package** — Still waiting on external delivery; integrate assets and rerun navigation/loader suites once available.
2. **Narrative/dialogue follow-ups** — New Act 2 objectives need scripted dialogue, overlays, and quest scripting alignment.
3. **Telemetry dashboard validation** — Verify analytics ingestion for the new `quest_trigger` payloads once dashboards refresh; adjust schemas if tagging mismatches surface.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Integrate the Crossroads art/navigation bundle and validate scene/layout tests.
- Sync with narrative team on dialogue + UI copy for the new Act 2 objectives, update quest scripting accordingly.
- Spot-check analytics dashboards / data warehouse to ensure `QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge` events map to expected reports.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated `QUEST-610` to record Session 95 progress, narrowed next steps to asset integration and narrative follow-ups.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors MCP priorities and refreshed next-session focus.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- New trigger IDs (`act2_*_projection_lab`, `act2_*_broadcast_terminal`, `act2_*_encryption_lab`, `act2_*_exfiltration_route`, `act2_*_coordination_chamber`, `act2_*_signal_array`) now exposed via navigation metadata and telemetry bridge payloads.
- `QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge` standardizes analytics emission for every registry-backed trigger, marking payloads dispatched to prevent duplicate listeners.
