# Autonomous Development Session #84 – Memory Parlor Trigger Migration & Performance Telemetry
**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h10m  
**Status**: Authored additional procedural variants, migrated Memory Parlor triggers onto the registry toolkit, and stood up a reusable performance telemetry snapshot for CI guardrails.

---

## Highlights
- Added detective office and alley hub entries to the authored template manifest (`src/game/procedural/templates/authoredTemplates.js`), including multi-edge seam metadata, factory support, and updated coverage in `tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`; refreshed `docs/guides/procedural-generation-integration.md` to note the expanded variant family.
- Migrated Memory Parlor entrance/interior/exit volumes to registry-backed quest triggers via `TriggerMigrationToolkit`, extended scene coverage with `tests/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.triggers.test.js`, and documented the migration in `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md`.
- Delivered `scripts/telemetry/performanceSnapshot.js` with npm alias `telemetry:performance`, producing JSON metrics for forensic analysis, faction cascade, and BSP generation thresholds; captured an initial dataset for CI baselining and recorded updates in the changelog/backlog.

---

## Deliverables
- Procedural variants: `src/game/procedural/templates/authoredTemplates.js`, `tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`, `docs/guides/procedural-generation-integration.md`.
- Memory Parlor trigger migration: `src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js`, `tests/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.triggers.test.js`, `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md`, `.gitignore` (telemetry artifacts), `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- Telemetry tooling: `scripts/telemetry/performanceSnapshot.js`, `package.json` (script alias), `telemetry-artifacts/performance/performance-metrics.json` (seed run), `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.triggers.test.js tests/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.readability.test.js`
- `npm run telemetry:performance` → averages: forensic **0.032 ms**, faction modify **0.0029 ms**, faction attitude **0.0002 ms**, BSP generation **5.65 ms** (single spike 13.20 ms but average under 10 ms threshold).

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Manifest breadth** – Continue authoring manifest variants for other high-traffic interiors (e.g., precinct war rooms, alley spurs) once level art delivers tilemaps; ensure seam metadata keeps corridor painter coverage consistent.
2. **Telemetry integration** – Wire `npm run telemetry:performance` into CI to accumulate multi-run history, surface regressions, and document alert thresholds per `PERF-119` next steps.
3. **Trigger audit** – Extend registry migrations beyond Act 1 scenes (e.g., Memory Parlor follow-up beats, Act 2 hubs) and add regression coverage for each conversion to ensure QuestSystem remains poll-free.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Hook the performance snapshot script into CI (or a scheduled localhost job) and capture the first five-run baseline for `PERF-119`.
- Identify the next batch of registry migrations (e.g., tutorial exit volumes or Act 2 hubs) and author integration tests mirroring the new Memory Parlor coverage.
- Coordinate with art/design for upcoming interior templates so we can author manifest variants and seam tags ahead of asset drops.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- **PROC-221** `completed_work` now records Session 84 detective office/alley hub variants plus documentation touchpoints.
- **QUEST-442** `completed_work` updated with Memory Parlor trigger migration and new scene-level Jest coverage.
- **PERF-119** logged the performance snapshot script delivery and queued CI integration as the next action.

## Metrics & Notes
- Telemetry snapshot (`telemetry-artifacts/performance/performance-metrics.json`): forensic avg **0.0317 ms**, faction modify avg **0.0029 ms**, faction attitude avg **0.0002 ms**, BSP generation avg **5.6532 ms** (max sample 13.2008 ms). All averages currently below guardrail thresholds.
- Memory Parlor quest triggers now share registry metadata (`narrativeBeat`, `requiresScrambler`) for adaptive audio/tooltips—documented in `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md`.
- `.gitignore` now excludes `telemetry-artifacts/` to keep generated performance reports out of source control.
