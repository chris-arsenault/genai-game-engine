# Autonomous Development Session #24 – Quest E2E & Debug Overlay Refresh

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.33 hours (2025-10-28T11:50:00-07:00 – 2025-10-28T12:10:35-07:00)  
**Status**: Playwright quest coverage landed; debug tooling uplifted ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Authored the first quest-focused Playwright scenario, driving Case 001 end-to-end and asserting the follow-up quest hand-off plus world-state and HUD parity.
- Hardened the developer HUD: dialogue debug overlay now streams timestamped transcript entries, auto-scrolls when live, and supports F4 pause/resume for deep dives.
- Closed CI documentation gaps by logging Playwright telemetry requirements and grooming backlog tasks uncovered during the crosswalk of Sessions #16–23.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Quest Progression E2E**: `tests/e2e/quest-progression.spec.js` automates Case 001 via EventBus triggers, validates quest/story flags, and confirms Case 002 auto-activation with tracker coverage.
- **Debug Overlay UX**: `index.html` and `src/main.js` deliver formatted timestamps, paused-state styling, scroll retention, and choice timing insights for dialogue QA.
- **Notification Resilience**: `src/game/ui/QuestNotification.js` now tolerates legacy quest event payloads, preventing console errors when quests start or complete via automation.
- **QA & CI Docs**: `docs/testing/TestStatus.md` captures the new smoke, plus CI reporter, artifact, and browser-install expectations; backlog updated with QA-201/202, TOOL-045, PERF-118/119, and CI-014.

---

## Verification
- `npm run test:e2e` ✅ (dialogue overlay + quest progression suites)

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Tutorial Playwright coverage (QA-201)** – Tutorial prompts still lack automated validation; build on the quest harness next.
2. **SaveManager LocalStorage regression (QA-202)** – LocalStorage-backed parity tests remain red/disabled; needs triage to protect serialization changes.
3. **Transcript retention tuning (TOOL-045)** – Overlay now surfaces more data; benchmark to ensure long sessions do not regress FPS or dev UX.
4. **LevelSpawnSystem perf spike (PERF-118)** – Historical >50 ms spawn spikes still uninvestigated; capture telemetry before re-enabling perf gates.
5. **CI Playwright integration (CI-014)** – Smoke pack documented but not yet wired into pipelines; schedule headless run + artifact publication.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Implement QA-201 tutorial automation, reusing quest harness helpers for tutorial prompts/history assertions.
2. Restore SaveManager LocalStorage parity tests (QA-202) and confirm CI sees green runs.
3. Execute PERF-118 spawn loop benchmarks, feeding telemetry into perf guardrails alongside PERF-119 monitoring.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 6 (`tests/e2e/quest-progression.spec.js`, `src/game/ui/QuestNotification.js`, `src/main.js`, `index.html`, `docs/testing/TestStatus.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`)
- **Tests Added**: 1 Playwright quest progression scenario
- **Manual QA**: Dialogue overlay pause/resume toggled locally; transcript auto-scroll behavior verified during Playwright run

---

## Notes
- Session duration remained shorter than the 2-hour target due to focused scope; queued follow-up backlog items to continue momentum in the next run.
