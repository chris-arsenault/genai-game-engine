# Autonomous Development Session #34 – Edge-Triggered UI Integration

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2.1 hours (2025-10-29T13:15:00-07:00 – 2025-10-29T15:20:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Input edge events wired through EventBus; narrative overlays instrumented ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Extended `InputState` to publish `input:action_pressed` plus action-scoped topics, unifying edge-trigger access for gameplay and UI consumers.
- Rewired DeductionSystem to listen to `input:deductionBoard:pressed`, eliminating DOM keydown hooks and ensuring the board only toggles once per Tab press.
- Brought CaseFileUI and DeductionBoard onto the overlay instrumentation path so debug HUD snapshots now surface case titles, clue counts, and board state.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **EventBus Edge Signals**: `Controls.js` emits `input:action_pressed` / `input:{action}:pressed` payloads, with Jest coverage guaranteeing single-fire behaviour (`src/game/config/Controls.js`, `tests/game/config/Controls.test.js`).
- **Deduction Board Toggle Reliability**: DeductionSystem consumes the new toggle event, propagates source metadata, and maintains regression tests for board state transitions (`src/game/systems/DeductionSystem.js`, `tests/game/systems/DeductionSystem.test.js`).
- **Overlay Telemetry Expansion**: CaseFileUI and DeductionBoard now pipe through `emitOverlayVisibility`, emit legacy open/close events with metadata, and show up in `Game.getOverlayStateSnapshot()` summaries (`src/game/ui/CaseFileUI.js`, `src/game/ui/DeductionBoard.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/config/Controls.test.js tests/game/systems/DeductionSystem.test.js tests/game/ui/CaseFileUI.test.js tests/game/ui/DeductionBoard.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Manual UI Sweep** – CORE-302 visual pass on overlay palettes and capture still pending; schedule once instrumentation stabilises other inputs.
2. **Debug HUD E2E Coverage** – Playwright smoke for the new overlay list remains outstanding; add once browser harness work resumes.
3. **Inventory Edge Adoption** – Inventory UI is still placeholder; ensure future implementation hooks into `input:inventory:pressed` to avoid repeat toggles.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Implement inventory panel toggling using the new action events once UI shell lands.
2. Author Playwright assertions that validate the debug overlay list during dialogue/tutorial scenarios.
3. Complete the CORE-302 manual overlay polish checklist leveraging the richer diagnostics.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 18 (`src/game/config/Controls.js`, `src/game/systems/DeductionSystem.js`, `src/game/ui/CaseFileUI.js`, `src/game/ui/DeductionBoard.js`, `src/game/Game.js`, `tests/game/config/Controls.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DeductionSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/CaseFileUI.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/DeductionBoard.test.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, plus dependent UI helper imports)
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 4 Jest suites
- **Automated Tests Run**: Targeted Jest command (see Verification)
- **Manual QA**: Not run – systems instrumentation only

---

## Notes
- All overlay emitters now share `emitOverlayVisibility`; include `{ source }` metadata when invoking `show`/`hide` so debug logs stay descriptive.
- DeductionSystem still emits its own `deduction_board:opened`/`closed` events for case awareness; listeners should deduplicate if both UI and system payloads are needed.
