# Autonomous Development Session #132 – Overlay Navigation Polish

**Date**: November 2, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 45m  
**Focus**: Improve control remap navigation ergonomics and surface remapped bindings across narrative HUD overlays.

---

## Summary
- Added list-mode cycling (category/alphabetical/conflicts) and paging to the Control Bindings overlay so large action sets stay navigable with keyboard-only input.
- Documented the active view/page inside the overlay detail panel and footer hints to clarify the new shortcuts.
- Surfaced dynamic binding cues inside the Case File and Quest Log overlays, ensuring narrative HUD copy mirrors remapped keys without stale hardcoded labels.
- Expanded Jest coverage to lock in the overlay navigation controls plus the new binding hints.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/ControlBindingsOverlay.js`: Added list mode metadata, cached row builders, pagination logic, rendering tweaks, and new key handling for view/page navigation.
- `src/game/ui/CaseFileUI.js`: Rendered binding hints for close/deduction/inventory actions using `controlBindingPrompts`.
- `src/game/ui/QuestLogUI.js`: Injected binding hints at the top of the quest log, reusing the binding label helpers.
- `tests/game/ui/ControlBindingsOverlay.test.js`: Added a navigation regression covering PgDn/`[` `]` shortcuts.
- `tests/game/ui/CaseFileUI.test.js`: Mocked binding helpers and asserted hint rendering.
- `tests/game/ui/QuestLogUI.test.js`: New suite validating quest log hint rendering.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Logged Session #132 with new backlog items.

---

## Verification
- `npm test`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Collect UX feedback on the new overlay mode/paging shortcuts (are additional tooltips or animations needed?).
2. Audit remaining HUD overlays (inventory, reputation, etc.) for potential binding hint parity.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Created MCP backlog items `INPUT-320` (overlay navigation enhancements) and `UI-520` (case/quest binding cues) and marked them **Done**.
- Updated `docs/plans/backlog.md` Session #132 section with summaries and verification notes mirroring the MCP entries.

---

## Notes
- Control overlay footer now lists `[: Prev view · ]: Next view · PgUp/PgDn: Page`, matching the newly wired shortcuts.
