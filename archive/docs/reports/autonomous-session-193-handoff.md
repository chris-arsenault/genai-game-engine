# Autonomous Development Session #193 – Investigation Runtime Validation

**Date**: 2025-11-03  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~70m  
**Focus**: Close the remaining investigation persistence loop by wiring SaveManager to the ECS case/investigation stack, add automated runtime validation, and sync planning artifacts.

## Summary
- Extended SaveManager to serialize/deserialize investigation abilities, evidence, and detective vision state alongside CaseManager progress, ensuring runtime restores align with ECS data.
- Added CaseManager serialization/hydration utilities and hooked Game bootstrap + event listeners so CaseFileUI refreshes automatically after load.
- Authored Playwright scenario `investigation-save-load.spec.js` covering a save/load cycle, plus expanded Jest coverage for CaseManager and SaveManager to guard the new persistence path.
- Closed backlog item M2-001, updated backlog/docs to reflect completion, and confirmed investigation persistence is fully automated.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js:78-210` — capture/restore investigation & case snapshots, guard helpers, and invoke during save/load.
- `src/game/managers/CaseManager.js:547-678` — serialize/deserialize case progress with hydration event emission.
- `src/game/Game.js:400-428` & `src/game/Game.js:1797-1845` — provide SaveManager with case/investigation handles and refresh CaseFileUI on `case:hydrated`.
- `tests/e2e/investigation-save-load.spec.js` — end-to-end verification of evidence/ability persistence through manual save/load.
- `tests/game/managers/CaseManager.test.js:218-288`, `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js` — new unit coverage for serialization hooks.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md:1871-1886` — M2-001 marked done with latest progress notes.

## Verification
- `npm test -- CaseManager`
- `npm test -- SaveManager`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. **AR-050** – Continue monitoring RenderOps feedback for the 2025-10-31 Act 2 Crossroads packet and prep the week-two bespoke sweep (`npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2`) on 2025-11-07.
2. **AR-050 / M3-016** – Re-run telemetry outbox checks during the 2025-11-07 automation window, logging autosave/lighting acknowledgements immediately.
3. **UX-410** – Execute `node scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.js --label autosave-20251107` on 2025-11-07 and archive results.
4. Execute the Playwright investigation suite (`npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/investigation-save-load.spec.js`) in the next CI/window to confirm browser automation passes alongside Jest.
