# Autonomous Development Session #112 – Crossroads Lighting Calibration & Telemetry Ack

**Date**: November 12, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h00m  
**Status**: Crossroads overlays recalibrated and synced with scene config; analytics acknowledgement logged; RenderOps validation and asset generation remain.

---

## Summary
- Added `scripts/art/analyzeCrossroadsOverlays.js` to profile luma/alpha density across the 13 Crossroads overlays, producing repeatable metrics for art direction reviews.
- Rebalanced tint, luma-floor, and boundary inversion parameters in `assets/images/overlay-derivatives-act2-crossroads.json`, regenerated the PNG suite, and documented the new alpha baselines.
- Updated `src/game/data/sceneArt/Act2CrossroadsArtConfig.js` with calibrated alpha values, `overlayAverageAlpha` metadata, and full boundary coverage so runtime overrides match the refreshed derivatives.
- Recorded analytics acknowledgement for `act2-crossroads-20251112` via `npm run telemetry:ack`, updated the dispatch README/log, and clarified CLI usage in `docs/guides/telemetry-parity-dispatch.md`.
- Refreshed `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` and MCP backlog entries (AR-050, QUEST-610) to reflect the calibration pass and telemetry follow-up.

## Deliverables
- `scripts/art/analyzeCrossroadsOverlays.js`
- Updated `assets/images/overlay-derivatives-act2-crossroads.json` + regenerated overlays in `assets/overlays/act2-crossroads/`
- Updated `src/game/data/sceneArt/Act2CrossroadsArtConfig.js`
- Documentation updates: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/guides/telemetry-parity-dispatch.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- Telemetry artefacts: `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/outbox/act2-crossroads-20251112/acknowledgement.json`, `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/acknowledgements.json`

---

## Verification
- `npm run art:generate-crossroads-overlays`
- `node scripts/art/analyzeCrossroadsOverlays.js`
- `npm test -- overlayPipeline`
- `npm test -- Act2CrossroadsScene.artOverrides`
- `node scripts/art/validateAct2CrossroadsArt.js`
- `npm run telemetry:ack -- --format json`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **RenderOps lighting validation** – Run calibrated overlays in-engine, gather qualitative feedback, and adjust derivative config if hotspots remain.
2. **Asset generation (AR-001 – AR-005)** – Feed packaged prompts through sourcing pipeline; backfill licensing metadata and manifests.
3. **Telemetry parity follow-up** – Schedule the next parity run once analytics drops a new sample; keep QUEST-610 aligned with telemetry cadence.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` – Added Session 112 calibration notes, updated next steps to focus on RenderOps review, metadata alignment, and pending generation runs.
- `QUEST-610: Act 2 Crossroads Trigger Migration` – Logged telemetry acknowledgement in completed work/notes and replaced the ack follow-up with future parity scheduling.
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Documented the analysis script, calibrated alpha targets, and new RenderOps coordination focus.
- `docs/guides/telemetry-parity-dispatch.md` – Clarified `telemetry:ack` flag usage (space-delimited arguments) to avoid missed acknowledgements.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Synced AR-050 narrative with the latest calibration work and revised next actions.

---

## Notes
- Overlay averages now land at ~0.13 (columns/conduits/pad) and ~0.75 (boundary shields); these values are captured in `overlayAverageAlpha` metadata for quick validation.
- Telemetry acknowledgement timestamp (2025-10-30T10:12:47.477Z) captured under RenderOps via Slack; future parity scheduling depends on the next analytics dump.
