# Autonomous Development Session #44 – Test Harness Restoration & Memory Parlor Return QA

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~4h05m (Start 2025-10-30T09:10:00-07:00 – End 2025-10-30T13:15:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Full Jest suite green again; new Playwright smoke covers the post-escape Act 1 return flow.

---

## Executive Summary
- Restored `npm test` signal by polyfilling `TransformStream`, shimming Canvas gradients, and keeping Playwright suites out of Jest runs.
- Tuned engine integration expectations for modern jsdom frame timing so performance checks no longer false-fail on faster Node runtimes.
- Authored a Memory Parlor return Playwright scenario that drives quest completion, knowledge unlock, and Captain Reese follow-up dialogue.
- Seeded evidence metadata in the debug overlay Playwright smoke to match the latest overlay copy and maintain UI coverage.
- Updated backlog, changelog, and MCP architecture records to capture the stabilized testing stack and new QA coverage.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Testing infrastructure**: `tests/setup.js`, `tests/engine/integration-full.test.js`, and `package.json` now provide browser polyfills and ignore Playwright specs during Jest execution, unlocking full-suite runs.
- **QA automation**: Added `tests/e2e/memory-parlor-return-dialogue.spec.js` to validate quest completion rewards, knowledge ledger sync, persistent player reuse, and Act 1 dialogue availability post-escape.
- **Debug overlay smoke**: Updated `tests/e2e/debug-overlay-inventory.spec.js` to seed evidence items and assert against the revised overlay wording.
- **Unit alignment**: `tests/game/systems/TutorialSystem.test.js` and `tests/game/ui/ReputationUI.test.js` now target the EventBus `.on` API and overlay metadata emitted during visibility toggles.
- **Documentation**: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/plans/backlog.md` reflect the restored test harness, new Playwright coverage, and debug overlay adjustments; architecture decision stored for the polyfill approach.

## Verification
- `npm test` *(pass)* – full Jest suite with polyfills and adjusted frame expectations.
- `npx playwright test` *(pass)* – all eight smoke scenarios including the new Memory Parlor return flow.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Memory Parlor polish**: Scene still uses placeholder art/AI; stealth readability and detection behaviours need an art/audio pass.
2. **CI integration**: Playwright smoke pack should be wired into the CI pipeline with artifact retention to guard against regressions.
3. **WorldState observability**: Follow through on WorldStateStore debug tooling (PO-003) so QA can inspect quest/story state during future smokes.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Begin the Memory Parlor art/audio pass and stealth readability tuning.
2. Integrate the Playwright smoke suite into CI with junit reporting and failure artifacts.
3. Extend WorldStateStore debug overlays to expose quest/story slices for post-return QA validation.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 8 test/infra files, 2 documentation files, 1 new report.
- **Automated Coverage**: 1 new Playwright scenario; existing Playwright pack updated; Jest suite green.
- **Commands Run**:  
  - `npm test`  
  - `npx playwright test tests/e2e/memory-parlor-return-dialogue.spec.js`  
  - `npx playwright test`
