# Autonomous Development Session #54 – Tutorial Automation Closure

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~65m (Start ≈2025-10-30T06:05:00Z – End ≈2025-10-30T07:10:00Z)  
**Status**: Tutorial Playwright suite now drives case file, forensic, and deduction board beats; backlog/docs refreshed; verification green.

---

## Executive Summary
- Introduced reusable event-driven helpers so tutorial automation can simulate UI-driven beats without bespoke engine plumbing.
- Added three new Playwright scenarios covering case file prompts, forensic analysis completion, and deduction board resolution, fulfilling QA-201 coverage goals.
- Synced QA-201 backlog notes and changelog entries to reflect the completed onboarding automation scope and remaining documentation follow-up.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Tutorial automation helpers**: Centralized tutorial event emitters and setup utilities in `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`, reducing duplication and enabling downstream scenarios.  
- **Case file prompt coverage**: New Playwright scenario `completes case file step once overlay opens` validates telemetry and state transitions when the case file overlay appears.  
- **Forensic & deduction flow**: Playwright now exercises forensic analysis completion and the deduction board through case resolution, ensuring tutorial context, prompt history, and completion flags update end-to-end.  
- **Backlog/documentation updates**: QA-201 backlog item and changelog now capture the expanded tutorial automation scope and leave documentation as the sole remaining follow-up (`docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`).

---

## Verification
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Automation documentation gap**: Need to capture troubleshooting guidance (event prerequisites, helper usage, artifact expectations) before closing QA-201.
2. **System parity**: Forensic and deduction flows still lean on simulated events; integrating the actual ForensicSystem and DeductionBoard into runtime would provide higher-fidelity validation.
3. **Adaptive audio benchmark**: CI wiring for the infiltration benchmark remains pending to surface regressions automatically.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 3 (`tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`)
- **New/Updated Tests**: 3 Playwright scenarios (`completes case file step once overlay opens`, `completes forensic analysis step via emitted events`, `completes deduction board flow through case resolution`)

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Draft the tutorial automation troubleshooting notes and link them from QA-201 to close out documentation requirements.
- Evaluate integrating ForensicSystem/DeductionBoard runtime hooks so future automation relies on live systems instead of simulated events.
- Resume adaptive audio CI integration to complete pending benchmark follow-through.

## Artifact Locations
- Tutorial automation helpers & scenarios: `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`
- Backlog update: `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- Changelog entry: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
