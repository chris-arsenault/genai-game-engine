# Autonomous Development Session #157 – Backlog & Artifact Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~0h 40m  
**Focus**: Backlog hygiene, artifact pruning, and documentation sync without new feature work.

## Summary
- Reviewed MCP backlog priorities (AR-003, AR-050, M3-016, supporting investigation arcs) and confirmed no stories could be safely closed while Save/Load follow-ups remain outstanding.
- Removed the unused sample output `example-case-output.json` that duplicated procedural case generator data and had no active references, shrinking tracked artifacts.
- Synced `docs/plans/backlog.md` metadata (`Last Updated`) to reflect the current review so markdown mirrors the authoritative MCP state.
- Logged cleanup outcomes for future cycles without introducing new content or implementation tasks.

## Deliverables
- `example-case-output.json` removed (unreferenced sample case artifact).
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` metadata refreshed (Last Updated → 2025-10-31).

## Verification
- Not run (documentation/backlog-only maintenance).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Distribute save/load profiling report and payload summary outputs to QA for schema sign-off; record any approvals or change requests. *(M3-016)*
2. Investigate the SaveManager world snapshot parity warnings versus legacy collectors observed during profiling runs. *(M3-016)*
3. Schedule autosave stress passes in-engine to validate focus cues, FX emissions, and event sequencing beyond unit coverage. *(M3-016 / M3-017 handoff)*
4. Continue tracking AR-003 & AR-050 asset sourcing once Save/Load follow-ups and parity checks are resolved; no status changes this session.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- MCP backlog reviewed; no status transitions executed due to open Save/Load follow-ups. Notes captured in this handoff for transparency.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` last-updated stamp reset to 2025-10-31 to reflect the audit; no content or priority changes applied.
- No new backlog items created; existing entries remain the authoritative source for upcoming work.
