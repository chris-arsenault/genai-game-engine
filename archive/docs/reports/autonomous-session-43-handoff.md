# Autonomous Development Session #43 – Memory Parlor Return Loop & Intel Sync

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~4h10m (Start 2025-10-29T09:05:00-07:00 – End 2025-10-29T13:15:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Memory Parlor scene supports full infiltration → intel collection → escape loop with automated coverage.

---

## Executive Summary
- Extended `MemoryParlorScene` with stealth cover geometry, intel evidence pickups, and an exit trigger that emits `neon_districts_street`, forcing objective-driven returns to Act 1.
- Added event-driven knowledge sync so collecting the client registry registers `memory_parlor_clients`, satisfying quest gating without bespoke scene wiring.
- Implemented `Game.returnToAct1FromMemoryParlor()` and `loadAct1Scene()` reuse-paths so the existing player entity (and disguise state) survive the quest transition back to Act 1.
- Augmented the Playwright infiltration spec to walk scrambler usage, evidence gathering, knowledge unlock, and scene exit, ensuring the end-to-end quest beat is covered.
- Updated backlog, changelog, and narrative quest documentation to reflect the completed Memory Parlor polish scope.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Scene updates**: `src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js` adds cover blocks around the firewall channel, exit zone registration, and intel evidence (including the client registry knowledge hook).
- **Scene management**: `src/game/Game.js` introduces `returnToAct1FromMemoryParlor()` plus option-aware `loadAct1Scene()`; `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js` now supports reusing the existing player entity.
- **Knowledge tracking**: `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js` records globally emitted `knowledge:learned` events, keeping the player knowledge ledger in sync with scene-level pickups.
- **Automated coverage**: `tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js` now exercises evidence collection, knowledge unlock, and the escape trigger returning to Act 1.
- **Documentation**: Updated `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/narrative/quests/act-1-quests.md` to document the completed SCN-410 work and new systems behaviour.
- **Architecture record**: Stored decision “Memory Parlor scene transitions reuse the persistent player entity and sync knowledge via shared events” in MCP for continuity.

## Verification
- `npm test` *(fails – unchanged canvas/Playwright environment issues)*  
  - `TransformStream is not defined` when Jest loads Playwright specs.  
  - jsdom renderer lacks `ctx.createLinearGradient`, breaking integration suites.
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js tests/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.test.js tests/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.scrambler.test.js` *(pass)*.
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js` *(pass)* – validates scrambler gate, intel pickups, knowledge unlock, and return transition.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Canvas/jsdom gaps**: Core integration suites still fail (`createLinearGradient` missing); we need a headless canvas shim or conditional renderer.
2. **Playwright in Jest**: `TransformStream` missing inside Jest continues to register as noise during `npm test`; consider skipping Playwright specs in Jest or providing a polyfill.
3. **Memory Parlor polish follow-up**: Level still uses proxy geometry/textures; art pass and detection AI hooks required for production fidelity.
4. **Quest regression breadth**: Add a smoke that continues through post-escape dialogue once geometry and narrative beats land.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Patch Jest environment (`TransformStream`, canvas gradient shim) so full `npm test` is signal-bearing again.
2. Author QA smoke (manual or automated) that covers escape dialogue and the return path to Act 1 vendors.
3. Begin the art/audio pass on Memory Parlor props and stealth cover once asset sourcing is lined up.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 8 source/test files, 3 documentation files, 1 new report.
- **Automated Coverage**: 1 Playwright scenario expanded; existing scrambler/disguise/quest Jest suites confirmed.
- **Commands Run**:  
  - `npm test`  
  - `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js tests/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.test.js tests/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.scrambler.test.js`  
  - `npx playwright test tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js`
