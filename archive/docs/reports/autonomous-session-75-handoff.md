# Autonomous Development Session #75 – Telemetry Fallback Analytics
**Date**: November 4, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h20m  
**Status**: Fallback usage now surfaces through CiArtifactPublisher metadata and a new analyzer CLI, giving us visibility into repeated artifact degradation.

---

## Highlights
- Extended `CiArtifactPublisher` metadata with a `fallbackSummary` section that captures attempt counts, provider health, and timestamps whenever upload fallbacks run.
- Authored `scripts/telemetry/analyzeFallbackUsage.js`, a CLI that aggregates `ci-artifacts.json` manifests into markdown/JSON reports with optional thresholds for CI alerting.
- Synced docs/backlog so PO-002 tracks the new monitoring flow and clarifies next milestones for portable uploaders.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.js` – Fallback summary instrumentation, provider normalization tweaks, and timestamped results for downstream analytics.
- `scripts/telemetry/analyzeFallbackUsage.js` – CLI utility to summarise fallback attempts with configurable output/thresholds.
- `package.json` – Added `npm run telemetry:fallback-report` entry for the new analyzer.
- `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` – Documented fallback metrics pipeline, backlog progress, and CLI usage.
- Tests: Updated `tests/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.test.js`; new `tests/scripts/telemetry/analyzeFallbackUsage.test.js` for CLI utilities.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.test.js tests/scripts/telemetry/analyzeFallbackUsage.test.js`

All targeted suites passed.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Integrate the fallback analyzer into CI summaries with agreed thresholds so repeated fallbacks raise clear warnings.
2. Prototype portable uploader configurations (e.g., S3/MinIO) to keep telemetry exports resilient outside GitHub-hosted runners.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Wire `npm run telemetry:fallback-report` into the telemetry workflow summary step and validate messaging under forced fallback scenarios.
- Outline design options for non-GitHub fallback providers (storage buckets, self-hosted runners) before implementation.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- `PO-002` updated with the new progress entry, refreshed next steps, and analyzer coverage notes.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Fallback summary now persists per-provider attempts (`ci-artifacts.json`), enabling trend analysis via the new CLI.
- No benchmark deltas observed this session; guardrails remain at dispatch mean 0.0108 ms / writer mean 0.82 ms from prior run.
