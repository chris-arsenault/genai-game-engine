# Autonomous Development Session #55 – Tutorial Runtime & Documentation Alignment

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~105m (Start ≈2025-10-30T01:25:00Z – End ≈2025-10-30T03:10:00Z)  
**Status**: Tutorial automation now drives the live runtime (CaseManager + DeductionSystem), documentation gap closed, full test suite green.

---

## Executive Summary
- Integrated `CaseManager` into `Game.initializeGameSystems`, seeded the tutorial case, and reworked Act 1 scene evidence so tutorial automation exercises live case data.
- Created `CaseFileUI` and `DeductionBoard` overlays inside the runtime, wiring input events, overlay telemetry, and WorldStateStore refreshes.
- Registered `DeductionSystem` with the SystemManager, added board attachment hooks, and updated Playwright to open/validate the board via real key events instead of event injection.
- Authored `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`, capturing the control map, helper usage, and failure modes required to close QA-201.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Runtime Case Flow**: `Game` now instantiates `CaseManager`, registers the Hollow Case, refreshes the Case File UI on case/evidence/clue events, and ensures Playwright can rely on `window.game.caseManager` (`src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/managers/CaseManager.js`, `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`).
- **UI Integration**: Case File and Deduction Board are created during UI initialization and rendered in `renderOverlays`; input actions (`Tab`, `B`) toggle the overlays via the EventBus (`src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/config/Controls.js`, `src/game/data/tutorialSteps.js`).
- **Deduction System Wiring**: `DeductionSystem` now supports late board attachment, guards against missing UI, and is registered at priority 29 so tutorial automation uses actual theory validation (`src/game/systems/DeductionSystem.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- **Automation Migration**: `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` has been rewritten to press real keys, add clue connections through `DeductionBoard.addConnection`, and rely on case manager accuracy to finish the tutorial.
- **Documentation**: Published `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md` (control map, helper checklist, runtime hooks) and mirrored completion in `docs/plans/backlog.md` + QA-201 MCP backlog item.

## Verification
- `npm test` (Jest suite) – all 87 suites / 1,947 tests passing.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Forensic UI fidelity**: Forensic automation still calls `ForensicSystem.initiateAnalysis` directly; future work could surface an in-game prompt to align with player interactions.
2. **Tutorial Scene reuse**: Dedicated `TutorialScene` still unused in runtime; evaluate consolidating scene logic to avoid divergence between tutorial data and Act 1 scaffolding.
3. **Playwright artifact capture**: retain TODO to add screenshot/video capture on failure for tutorial cases (acceptance criterion in QA-201 remains optional but not automated yet).

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 13 code/docs + 1 new guide.
- **Tests Updated**: 6 unit tests (`CaseManager`, `DeductionSystem`, `Controls`, `Game UI`) + `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Evaluate exposing forensic automation through a UI prompt to eliminate direct system calls.
- Consider consolidating tutorial case data with Act 1 quest definitions to avoid dual maintenance.
- Extend Playwright artifacts pipeline to persist screenshots/videos on tutorial failures.

## Artifact Locations
- Runtime integrations: `src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/managers/CaseManager.js`, `src/game/systems/DeductionSystem.js`.
- Playwright tutorial suite: `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`.
- Troubleshooting guide: `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`.
- Backlog mirror: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (QA-201 section).
