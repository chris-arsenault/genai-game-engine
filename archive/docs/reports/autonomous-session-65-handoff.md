# Autonomous Development Session #65 – Telemetry Export Pipeline

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h15m (Start ≈2025-10-30T10:35:00-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-30T11:50:00-07:00)  
**Status**: SaveManager now emits JSON/CSV telemetry artifacts, narrative-mission Playwright flow validates cascade exports, and observability docs/backlog are refreshed with benchmark confirmation.

---

## Executive Summary
- Delivered `SaveManager.exportInspectorSummary()` backed by a new telemetry exporter that turns HUD inspector data into JSON and CSV artifacts for QA/CI capture, complete with Jest coverage.
- Authored `tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js` to progress the Memory Parlor mission, trigger faction cascades through `FactionReputationSystem`, and assert HUD telemetry plus export artifacts stay synchronized.
- Re-ran `benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js`, holding dispatch latency at **0.0100 ms** (≤0.25 ms budget), and updated documentation/backlog to describe the export workflow and new coverage points.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Telemetry export pipeline**: `src/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.js` formats SaveManager summaries into shareable JSON/CSV artifacts; `SaveManager.exportInspectorSummary()` exposes the pipeline with optional writer hooks for automation.
- **Expanded automated coverage**: Jest suites cover exporter normalization and SaveManager’s writer contract; Playwright `cascade-mission-telemetry` scenario validates cascade/timeline telemetry during narrative play and inspects generated artifacts.
- **Docs & backlog sync**: `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` and the tutorial automation guide now describe export commands for QA; backlog item `PO-002` records the export work, updated follow-ups, and benchmark metrics (dispatch 0.0100 ms).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- SaveManager`
- `npm test -- inspectorTelemetryExporter`
- `./run_playwright.sh test tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js`
- `node benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Integrate the telemetry export pipeline with CI artifact publishing and manual QA tooling (writer integration, storage targets).  
2. Extend exports to include tutorial prompt transcripts once slice data is exposed; continue broadening Playwright coverage across additional narrative beats.  
3. Monitor world-state dispatch timing after export persistence hooks land to ensure the 0.25 ms guardrail remains intact.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Wire `SaveManager.exportInspectorSummary()` into automation (CI uploads, QA capture commands) and validate writer callbacks in headless environments.  
- Surface tutorial transcript data through the store/exporter and add regression coverage for transcript artifacts.  
- Re-run Playwright mission flows after integrating export persistence to confirm HUD telemetry and artifacts remain aligned under real storage.
