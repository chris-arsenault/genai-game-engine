# Autonomous Development Session #127 – Collider Metadata Hotfix

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 35m  
**Focus**: Stabilize collision detection during project load by preserving collider shape metadata, expand regression coverage, and realign backlog priorities around the blocker.

---

## Summary
- Refactored the Collider component so ECS registration no longer overwrites geometric metadata, preventing `shapeA/shapeB` null dereferences during collision checks.
- Added guard rails in `CollisionSystem.testCollision` and extended engine physics test suites to ensure malformed colliders are ignored gracefully instead of crashing.
- Updated architectural notes, backlog priorities, and session planning to track the newly elevated BUG-201 while pausing dependent workstreams.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/components/Collider.js`: store `shapeType` separately from the ECS `type` identifier and normalize bounds queries to the new metadata.
- `src/engine/physics/CollisionSystem.js`: null-safety check before invoking `detectCollision` to skip entities missing shape data.
- `tests/engine/physics/CollisionSystem.test.js`: remove legacy collider wrappers, add regression coverage for missing shape metadata.
- `tests/engine/physics/integration.test.js`, `tests/engine/integration-full.test.js`: streamline collider test doubles to obey the new component contract.
- `docs/architecture/decisions/004-spatial-hash-collision.md`: document the `shapeType` guideline so future authors avoid clobbering collider metadata.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`: insert BUG-201, mark affected initiatives blocked, and update the high-priority table timestamp.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- CollisionSystem`
- `npm test -- physics/integration`
- `npm test -- integration-full`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Run the full Jest suite in CI to confirm no downstream systems rely on the old collider contract.
2. Spot-check entity factories for redundant `collider.type = 'Collider'` assignments once BUG-201 is closed to keep shape metadata tidy.
3. Observe the next playtest or dev server boot to ensure no new collision warnings surface after the refactor.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Added backlog item `BUG-201` (P0) and blocked AR-050, AR-003, M3-001, M3-008, and M2-001 until the collision fix stabilizes.
- Captured the collider metadata change as an architecture decision via MCP and refreshed the collision decision doc snippet to emphasize `shapeType` usage.
- Refreshed `docs/plans/backlog.md` header timestamp to October 30, 2025 in line with the new priorities.

---

## Notes
- Manual collider assignments that overwrite `shapeType` will now simply skip collision handling; leave the new guard in place even if future factories become stricter to keep runtime resilient.
