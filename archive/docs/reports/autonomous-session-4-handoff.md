## 🚀 Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

#### Option A: Complete Sprint 2 (RECOMMENDED)
**Why**: Finish investigation mechanics before moving to new systems
**Tasks** (5 hours):
1. M2-015: Tutorial Sequence Implementation (3 hours)
   - Step-by-step tutorial overlay
   - 7-10 guided steps through all mechanics
   - Skip functionality
2. M2-020: Polish and Bug Fix Pass (2 hours)
   - Integration testing with all systems
   - UI polish and animations
   - Documentation updates

**Outcome**: Complete vertical slice of investigation gameplay, ready for playtesting

#### Option B: Begin Sprint 3 (ALTERNATIVE)
**Why**: Parallelize work, faction system is independent
**Tasks** (8 hours):
1. M3-001: Faction Data Definitions (4 hours)
2. M3-002: FactionManager Implementation (4 hours)

**Outcome**: Faction system foundation ready for expansion

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach (PRAGMATIC)
**Why**: High-value Sprint 2 tasks + Sprint 3 foundation
**Sprint 2** (3 hours):
- M2-015: Tutorial Sequence (3 hours)

**Sprint 3** (4 hours):
- M3-001: Faction Data Definitions (4 hours)

**Outcome**: Tutorial guidance + faction system groundwork

**My Recommendation**: **Option A** (Complete Sprint 2)
- **Reason**: Vertical slice completion highest value for stakeholders
- **Impact**: Playable investigation demo demonstrates unique gameplay
- **Risk**: Lower (building on working systems vs new systems)
- **Timeline**: 1 day of focused work

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Issue 1: CollisionSystem Unit Tests (P2 - Non-Blocking)

**Status**: Known issue from Session #3
**Problem**: 13/20 CollisionSystem unit tests failing due to test harness issue
**Impact**: NONE - Integration tests pass, system works correctly
**Solution**: Refactor test harness or use `shapeType` property
**Priority**: P2 (defer to post-Sprint 2 cleanup)

### Issue 2: Tutorial Sequence Not Yet Implemented

**Status**: Remaining Sprint 2 task
**Problem**: Players have no guided introduction to mechanics
**Impact**: Medium - First-time users may struggle without guidance
**Solution**: Implement M2-015 (3 hours estimated)
**Priority**: P1 (complete before playtesting)

### Issue 3: Asset Creation Still Pending

**Status**: Ongoing
**Problem**: All systems use programmer art/placeholders
**Impact**: Visual polish missing, cannot validate asset loading
**Solution**: Create or source assets from `assets/*/requests.json`
**Priority**: P1 for demo, P2 for development

## 📝 Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Queue-Based Forensic Analysis

**Context**: Multiple evidence items may need forensic analysis
**Options Considered**:
1. Sequential queue-based processing
2. Parallel analysis of all items
3. Instant analysis (no delay)

**Decision**: Sequential queue-based processing
**Rationale**:
- Maintains gameplay clarity and pacing
- Provides clear player feedback via progress events
- Enables UI progress bars and animations
- Supports player control (cancellation)

**Impact**: Clear, predictable gameplay with good player feedback

### Decision 2: Node-Based Dialogue Trees

**Context**: Need flexible, reusable dialogue system
**Options Considered**:
1. Linear dialogue with simple branching
2. Node-based tree structure
3. Script-based dialogue (Ink/Yarn)

**Decision**: Node-based tree structure with builder pattern
**Rationale**:
- Flexible and extensible
- Easy to author and test
- Validation ensures correctness
- No external dependencies
- Supports complex conditions and consequences

**Impact**: Powerful dialogue system ready for Act 1 content

### Decision 3: Canvas-Based Case File UI

**Context**: Need visual case tracking interface
**Options Considered**:
1. DOM-based UI (HTML/CSS)
2. Canvas-based UI (matching existing)

**Decision**: Canvas-based UI matching deduction board
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing UI style
- Better performance (no DOM reflows)
- Single rendering context
- Achieves 60 FPS target easily

**Impact**: Consistent UI experience, performant rendering
