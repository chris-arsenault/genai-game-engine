# Autonomous Development Session #59 – System Registration Stabilization

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~20m (Start ≈2025-10-29T03:03:00-07:00 – End 2025-10-29T03:23:18-07:00)  
**Status**: Event bus wiring restored via centralized system registration; gameplay bootstrap no longer double-initializes systems.

---

## Executive Summary
- Modernized `SystemManager.registerSystem` to accept named/priority options, enforce single init, and resort after systems adjust priorities.
- Refactored `Game.initializeGameSystems` to rely entirely on the engine registration path, eliminating manual `init()` calls and guaranteeing shared EventBus injection.
- Added focused Jest coverage for both the engine registration API and the gameplay bootstrap to lock the new behavior in place.
- Updated backlog, architecture decisions, and test documentation to reflect the stabilized startup path.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **SystemManager API upgrade**: Options-aware registration with post-init sorting; supports deferred init and priority overrides (`src/engine/ecs/SystemManager.js`, `tests/engine/ecs/SystemManager.test.js`).
- **Game bootstrap alignment**: Gameplay systems now register with canonical names through SystemManager, no manual double-init (`src/game/Game.js`, `src/engine/Engine.js`, `src/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.js`).
- **New guardrails**: Added `tests/game/Game.systemRegistration.test.js` to verify registration names, dependency injection, and tutorial listener wiring.
- **Backlog & docs refreshed**: PO-001 marked resolved in MCP + backlog, TestStatus and architecture research updated to document the new contract.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- SystemManager`
- `npm test -- Game.systemRegistration`
- `npm test`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Run a quick `npm run dev` smoke in browser to confirm the loading screen is clean post-refactor (no access this session).
2. Audit remaining gameplay systems for legacy `this.events` vs `this.eventBus` usage to ensure consistent dependency access.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Validate browser startup manually and capture any residual console noise for QA.
- Continue `PO-002` world-state observability work now that runtime boot is unblocked.
