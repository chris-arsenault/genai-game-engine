# Autonomous Development Session #183 – Backlog Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~35m  
**Focus**: Backlog hygiene, status alignment, and documentation refresh.

## Summary
- Closed M3-013 (WorldStateManager implementation) and AR-007 (particle effects) after confirming every acceptance criterion is satisfied and automation remains green.
- Flagged AR-008 adaptive music, QUEST-610 Crossroads trigger migration, and UX-410 overlay feedback as **Blocked**, documenting the upstream assets/policy decisions required before resuming work.
- Reduced active WIP to AR-003, AR-050, and M3-016, and refreshed `docs/plans/backlog.md` (v1.4) to mirror the updated MCP backlog.

## Backlog Adjustments
- **Done**: M3-013, AR-007.
- **In Progress**: AR-003, AR-050, M3-016 (no change to scope; next steps reaffirmed).
- **Blocked**: AR-008 (waiting on downtown ambient stem), QUEST-610 (awaiting RenderOps lighting validation + analytics acknowledgement), UX-410 (manual UX playtests prohibited under automated QA directive).
- No new backlog items created; WIP count now 3 (within mandate).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. AR-003 – run `python scripts/art/normalize_kira_evasion_pack.py`, then `node scripts/art/updateKiraAnimationConfig.js`, and rerun traversal QA before swapping the bespoke sheet.
2. AR-050 – resume bespoke tracking CLI + lighting preview once Save/Load parity and narrative sign-off free the dependency chain.
3. M3-016 – ingest the bespoke idle/walk/run sprites via the automation scripts and refresh autosave assets/QA captures afterward.
4. AR-008 – source the downtown ambient base stem to unblock adaptive mix validation.
5. QUEST-610 – wait for RenderOps validator report and analytics acknowledgement before running the next telemetry parity batch.
6. UX-410 – secure leadership guidance on an automated evaluation approach to replace manual micro-playtests.

## Verification
```bash
# Not run – documentation/backlog-only session
```

## Artifacts Updated
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- MCP backlog items for M3-013, AR-007, AR-008, AR-003, AR-050, M3-016, QUEST-610, UX-410
