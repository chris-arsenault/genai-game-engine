# Autonomous Development Session #45 – Memory Parlor Readability & CI Automation

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h15m (Start 2025-10-30T16:15:00-07:00 – End 2025-10-30T17:30:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Memory Parlor stealth readability upgraded; world-state debug overlay and CI smoke automation landed.

---

## Executive Summary
- Boosted Memory Parlor readability with guard detection halos, ambient lighting, and dynamic prompts tied to scrambler events, plus targeted unit coverage.
- Extended the in-game debug overlay to surface quest/story slices from WorldStateStore via a reusable helper with dedicated tests.
- Wired a GitHub Actions workflow that runs Jest + Playwright smoke pack headlessly, emits JUnit, and uploads artifacts to unblock CI telemetry.
- Logged placeholder audio (FreePD "Goodnightmare") and visual reference (Unsplash "Futuristic chamber") for the upcoming Memory Parlor art/audio pass.

## Key Outcomes
- **Memory Parlor polish**: Added neon detection halos, guard sweep prompts, and ambient floor lighting, all reacting to scrambler events, with new readability tests (`src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js`, `tests/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.readability.test.js`).
- **World-state observability**: Debug overlay now lists active quests and freshest story flags using new helper logic and unit coverage (`index.html`, `src/main.js`, `src/game/ui/helpers/worldStateDebugView.js`, `tests/game/ui/worldStateDebugView.test.js`).
- **CI automation**: Introduced `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to install Playwright Chromium, run Jest, execute smoke pack with `line+junit` reporters, and upload artifacts for failure triage.
- **Asset sourcing**: Recorded ambient loop candidate and neon interior reference in `assets/music/requests.json` and `assets/images/requests.json` for the forthcoming art/audio integration.

---

## Verification
- `npm test` *(pass)* – full Jest suite.
- `npx playwright test` *(pass)* – eight smoke scenarios.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Memory Parlor art/audio finalization**: Need bespoke environment art pass and to integrate the sourced ambient track once AudioManager streaming is ready.
2. **Audio system gap**: AudioManager still stubbed; ambient/sweep cues cannot yet play—requires implementation before asset integration.
3. **CI telemetry follow-through**: Configure retention dashboards and extend artifact storage (e.g., HTML report) once pipeline stabilizes.
4. **Session length**: Automation window under 4h due to CLI constraints; continue Memory Parlor polish tasks next run.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Import or generate Memory Parlor interior art/audio assets and hook them into Scene + AudioFeedbackController.
2. Implement AudioManager music playback so ambient loop can engage with scrambler phases.
3. Add CI job to publish Playwright HTML report / traces to facilitate flake triage.
4. Expand world-state debug overlay documentation and coordinate with QA on usage notes.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: Memory Parlor scene + config, main debug overlay script, new helpers/tests, asset request logs, CI workflow, changelog/backlog.
- **Automated Coverage**: 2 new Jest suites (Memory Parlor readability, world-state debug helper); Playwright pack unchanged but confirmed green.
- **Commands Run**: `npm test`, `npx playwright test`.

---

## Asset Sourcing Notes
- **Ambient Loop**: "Goodnightmare" by Kevin MacLeod (FreePD, CC0/Public Domain) – recorded for Memory Parlor ambient bed (`assets/music/requests.json`).
- **Visual Reference**: Unsplash ID `8ZsBU6LBfO0` (itsiken) – futuristic chamber lighting reference for Memory Parlor art pass (`assets/images/requests.json`).
