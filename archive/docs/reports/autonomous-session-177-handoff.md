# Autonomous Development Session #177 – Telemetry Wind-Down

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~15m  
**Focus**: Close remaining telemetry/performance backlog work and document the freeze on future telemetry initiatives.

## Summary
- Closed backlog item `PERF-119: Procedural Guardrail Monitoring`, marking all telemetry/performance guardrail initiatives complete per directive.
- Updated `docs/plans/backlog.md` to reflect the telemetry/performance freeze, removing upcoming telemetry work from the session focus and documenting the directive under governance.

## Deliverables
- MCP backlog update: `PERF-119` status set to `done` with notes freezing telemetry/performance work.
- Documentation revision: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (governance note, updated next-session focus, PERF-119 status + freeze callout).

## Verification
- Not run (documentation-only updates).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Respect the directive: do not schedule or create new telemetry/performance testing work.
2. Monitor backlog grooming to ensure no telemetry/performance items are reintroduced accidentally.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `PERF-119` closed and annotated in MCP backlog.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` aligned with the new telemetry/performance freeze directive.
