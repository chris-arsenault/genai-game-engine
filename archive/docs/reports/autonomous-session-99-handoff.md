# Autonomous Development Session #99 - Act 2 Crossroads Final Art & Narrative Packet
**Date**: November 7, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h00m  
**Status**: Final art metadata wired into the Crossroads hub, narrative export pipeline now delivers reviewer-ready Markdown, and telemetry dashboard tooling is locked down with schema regression coverage.

---

## Highlights
- Upgraded `assets/manifests/act2-crossroads-art.json` with the bespoke art bundle (asset IDs, lighting presets, narrative cues) and refreshed overrides/tests so designers can hot-drop textures without touching code.
- Extended the Act 2 branch dialogue exporter with Markdown rendering utilities, CLI flags, and generated `docs/narrative/dialogue/act2-branch-dialogue-review.md` for VO/narrative review.
- Refactored the telemetry dashboard exporter into a reusable helper and added schema-focused Jest coverage to flag missing fields or duplicate emits before analytics ingestion.

---

## Deliverables
- Art pipeline: `assets/manifests/act2-crossroads-art.json`, `src/game/data/sceneArt/Act2CrossroadsArtConfig.js`, `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`, `tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.artOverrides.test.js`
- Narrative tooling: `src/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.js`, `scripts/narrative/exportAct2BranchDialogues.js`, `tests/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.test.js`, `docs/narrative/dialogue/act2-branch-dialogue-review.md`
- Telemetry tooling: `scripts/telemetry/exportQuestTelemetryDashboard.js`, `tests/scripts/exportQuestTelemetryDashboard.test.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.analytics.test.js`
- Docs: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.artOverrides.test.js tests/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.analytics.test.js tests/scripts/exportQuestTelemetryDashboard.test.js`
- `npm test` *(fails the known `BSPGenerator` perf variance: expected <10 ms, observed ~11 ms — unchanged from prior sessions)*

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Crossroads art QA sweep** – Walk the final bundle in-engine (lighting/collision/navigation) and capture any follow-up tweaks from art/design.
2. **Narrative copy review** – Circulate `docs/narrative/dialogue/act2-branch-dialogue-review.md`, ingest edits into dialogue assets, and rerun the exporter bundle.
3. **Telemetry parity check** – Run `npm run telemetry:dashboard` against fresh production captures once the warehouse refresh lands, verifying schema parity.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Perform Crossroads hub QA with bespoke art and log adjustments for lighting/performance.
- Gather narrative/VO feedback on the Markdown review packet and back-port requested copy changes.
- Push production telemetry through `npm run telemetry:dashboard` and compare to warehouse schema.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- `QUEST-610` updated with Session 99 deliverables, refreshed next steps (art QA, narrative feedback loop, telemetry parity run), and notes referencing the Markdown packet.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the revised short-term focus.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Art manifest now carries `assetId`, `lightingPreset`, and `narrativeCue` metadata per segment, enabling TriggerMigration flows to react without code edits.
- Markdown exporter produces a branch-by-branch dialogue packet (6 dialogues) with quest/telemetry metadata for rapid reviewer consumption.
- Telemetry exporter regression tests confirm duplicate detection and missing-field reporting before analytics ingestion.
