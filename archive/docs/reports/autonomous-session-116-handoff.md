# Autonomous Development Session #116 – RenderOps Packet Automation & Telemetry Reminders

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h15m  
**Status**: RenderOps packet bundler, placeholder audit pipeline, and telemetry cadence reminders delivered with automated reports.

---

## Summary
- Built `RenderOpsPacketBuilder` + `npm run art:package-renderops` to generate timestamped RenderOps packets with actionable lighting metadata, then produced `reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-10-30T11-09-17-708Z/`.
- Authored placeholder audit tooling (`PlaceholderAudit`, `npm run art:audit-placeholders`) to surface all `placeholder-generated` manifest entries and confirm asset presence; outputs live under `reports/art/placeholder-audit.{json,md}`.
- Automated telemetry cadence monitoring via `evaluateTelemetrySchedule` and `npm run telemetry:reminder`, emitting JSON/Markdown status reports in `reports/telemetry/` so upcoming parity deadlines stay visible.

---

## Deliverables
- Engine/tooling: `src/game/tools/RenderOpsPacketBuilder.js`, `PlaceholderAudit.js`, `TelemetryScheduleReminder.js` with companion CLI scripts in `scripts/art/` and `scripts/telemetry/`.
- Tests: `tests/game/tools/RenderOpsPacketBuilder.test.js`, `PlaceholderAudit.test.js`, `TelemetryScheduleReminder.test.js`.
- Reports: `reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-10-30T11-09-17-708Z/*`, `reports/art/placeholder-audit.(json|md)`, `reports/telemetry/parity-schedule-reminder.(json|md)`.
- Documentation/backlog: Session 116 updates recorded in `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` and `docs/plans/backlog.md`; new backlog item `TEL-021` logged in MCP.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- RenderOpsPacketBuilder`
- `npm run art:package-renderops`
- `npm test -- PlaceholderAudit`
- `npm run art:audit-placeholders`
- `npm test -- TelemetryScheduleReminder`
- `npm run telemetry:reminder`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **RenderOps follow-up** – Deliver the generated packet to RenderOps, gather feedback on the two `skipped` floor segments, and regenerate the bundle after any art tweaks.
2. **Bespoke asset sourcing** – Use `reports/art/placeholder-audit.md` to schedule replacements for AR-001–AR-005 placeholders and update `assets/images/requests.json` with final licensing once approved.
3. **Telemetry cadence** – Re-run `npm run telemetry:reminder` as the 2025-11-13 checkpoint approaches and prep parity samples if analytics expands coverage.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` – Added Session 116 automation work to `completed_work`; `next_steps` now reference the RenderOps packet and placeholder audit workflows.
- `TEL-021: Parity Schedule Reminder Automation` – New backlog item created (status: done) capturing the telemetry reminder tooling and verification commands.
- Docs refreshed: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` (Session 116 section + new next actions) and `docs/plans/backlog.md` (updated high-priority table, session focus, and telem reminder entry).

---

## Notes
- RenderOps metadata reports actionable segments as an array; current bundle flags the two floor overlays still marked `skipped` so the team knows manual review is required.
- Placeholder audit confirms all 16 interim atlases exist; re-run after each manifest update to keep bespoke sourcing priorities current.
- Telemetry reminder output currently reports status `scheduled` (~14 days remaining); adjust `--warning-days` if analytics wants earlier alerts.
