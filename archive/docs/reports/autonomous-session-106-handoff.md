# Autonomous Development Session #106 - Renderer Profiling & Asset Intake
**Date**: November 12, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h05m  
**Status**: Renderer responsiveness and profiling complete; asset sourcing pipeline inventoried and ready for sourcing sprints.

---

## Highlights
- Logged every outstanding visual asset requirement into `assets/images/requests.json` and published a sourcing guide in `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`.
- Shipped responsive canvas sizing with configurable defaults in `Renderer`, ensuring window resizes propagate cleanly without manual hooks.
- Instrumented `SystemManager` with per-system timing metrics, entity counts, and rolling averages for upcoming performance dashboards.

---

## Deliverables
- Asset tracking: `assets/images/requests.json`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`.
- Rendering core: `src/engine/renderer/Renderer.js`, `tests/engine/renderer/Renderer.test.js`.
- ECS orchestration: `src/engine/ecs/SystemManager.js`, `tests/engine/ecs/SystemManager.test.js`.
- Backlog sync: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (status + metadata refresh).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- Renderer`
- `npm test -- SystemManager`
- `npm test`

All suites passed (146/146).

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Asset sourcing pipeline (AR-050)** – Need CC0/CC-BY candidates for Act 2 Crossroads overlays and prompt templates for AR-001–AR-005 UI packages. Pending web_search/OpenAI runs.
2. **RenderOps hardware validation** – Re-run Crossroads lighting preset validations to confirm no regressions after renderer resizing adjustments.
3. **Analytics ingestion follow-up** – Verify telemetry package `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/outbox/act2-crossroads-20251112` is processed before preparing the next dispatch.
4. **Profiling visibility** – Surface new SystemManager metrics in the debug overlay/telemetry so performance insights aren’t siloed in engine internals.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Execute AR-050 sourcing attempts (start with Crossroads selection pad & checkpoint plaza references).
- Schedule the RenderOps validation pass and capture any lighting threshold adjustments.
- Confirm analytics pipeline ingestion and set up the next telemetry parity label.
- Prototype debug overlay integration that reads `SystemManager.getLastFrameMetrics()`.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- AR-050 marked **In Progress** with updated next steps and documentation linkage.
- M1-007 and M1-004 marked **Completed** (renderer responsiveness + SystemManager profiling) with tests recorded in MCP.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` timestamp + status lines reflect the latest MCP state.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- `SystemManager.getLastFrameMetrics()` now exposes per-system `queryTime`, `updateTime`, and rolling averages (120 frame window) for telemetry hooks.
- Responsive renderer defaults to 1280×720 fallback, but honours DOM client sizing and removes resize listeners on cleanup.
- Asset inventory now tracks 36 open visual items spanning AR-001–AR-007 plus Act 2 Crossroads bundle; each includes usage notes to accelerate sourcing prompts.
