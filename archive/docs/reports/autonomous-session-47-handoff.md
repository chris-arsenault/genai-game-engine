# Autonomous Development Session #47 – Adaptive Audio Layering & SFX Catalog

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h35m (Start 2025-10-29T19:05:00Z – End 2025-10-29T21:40:00Z)  
**Status**: Adaptive music layering online, SFX catalog bootstrap complete, CI summary published.

---

## Executive Summary
- Delivered adaptive music layering infrastructure (`AdaptiveMusicLayerController`) and rewired Memory Parlor ambience to react to scrambler alert windows with clean fallbacks.
- Sourced CC0 UI cues from Kenney, populated `assets/sfx/catalog.json`, and ensured SFX buffers preload during `Game.init` for AudioFeedbackController.
- Enhanced GitHub Actions Playwright job with Markdown summary capturing pass/fail counts plus artifact pointers.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Adaptive music stack**: Added `src/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusicLayerController.js`, surfaced `AudioManager.getBuffer/createBusGain`, and updated `AmbientSceneAudioController` to drive alert state transitions while preserving fallback playback.
- **SFX catalog integration**: Authored `src/game/audio/SFXCatalogLoader.js`, added CC0 Kenney UI cues under `assets/sfx/ui/`, and wired loader during `Game.initializeAudioIntegrations()`.
- **Tests & coverage**: New Jest suites covering adaptive controller, SFX loader, and updated ambient controller behavior (`tests/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusicLayerController.test.js`, `tests/game/audio/SFXCatalogLoader.test.js`, updated ambient tests).
- **Docs & backlog**: Created `docs/plans/adaptive-music-plan.md`, extended audio system plan with Phase 4 milestones, and logged backlog entries AUDIO-305/306/307 for ongoing tuning and asset expansion.
- **CI tooling**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now appends Playwright stats and artifact notes to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

## Verification
- `npx jest tests/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusicLayerController.test.js`
- `npx jest tests/game/audio/AmbientSceneAudioController.test.js`
- `npx jest tests/game/audio/SFXCatalogLoader.test.js`
- `npm test`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Bespoke stems pending**: Combat/tension layers currently reuse ambient stem; need sourced assets plus combat/disguise event wiring (tracked as AUDIO-307).
2. **Adaptive telemetry polish**: Hook adaptive state telemetry into debug overlays once quest/combat UIs mature to visualize mixes live.
3. **Catalog expansion**: Add investigation/combat/UI error cues and register them with AssetManager manifest; ensure licensing notes accompany each addition.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Source tension/combat stems, finalize adaptive state table, and add Playwright coverage for combat transitions.
2. Expand SFX catalog with investigative cues; expose selection UI for narrative designers to preview clips.
3. Integrate adaptive state telemetry into debug overlay and profile scrambler spam for gain ramp stability.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 16 (audio engine, game init/audio, CI workflow, docs, assets)
- **Tests Added**: 2 suites (adaptive controller, SFX loader) + ambient controller updates
- **Assets Added**: 3 Kenney UI SFX (CC0, see catalog)

---

## Asset Sourcing Notes
- **Kenney UI Audio Pack (CC0)**: Extracted `Audio/rollover3.ogg`, `Audio/switch16.ogg`, and `Audio/click3.ogg`; stored as `assets/sfx/ui/ui-movement-pulse.ogg`, `ui-prompt-chime.ogg`, and `evidence-collect.ogg`. Catalog entries record source URL (`https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-audio`) and derivation notes.
- **Adaptive mix stems**: Tension/combat placeholders reuse ambient stem until bespoke CC0/commissioned stems are delivered.
