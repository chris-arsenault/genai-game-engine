# Autonomous Development Session #81 – Adaptive Bridge Coverage & Rotation Scaffolding
**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h45m  
**Status**: Shipped end-to-end adaptive audio coverage with debug diagnostics, stood up rotation variant infrastructure, refreshed backlog/docs, and kept the suite green.

---

## Highlights
- Authored `tests/game/audio/GameplayAdaptiveAudioIntegration.test.js` to exercise disguise/combat/scrambler flows through `Game.update`, ensuring the adaptive bridge emits the expected moods.
- Extended the debug audio overlay (`src/main.js`, `index.html`) plus `Game.getGameplayAdaptiveBridgeTelemetry()` so designers can inspect live suspicion/scrambler state while tuning.
- Introduced `TemplateVariantResolver`, `TilemapTransformer`, and `CorridorSeamPainter` scaffolding, refactoring `DistrictGenerator` to run room placement through the new pipeline with coverage in `tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`.

---

## Deliverables
- `tests/game/audio/GameplayAdaptiveAudioIntegration.test.js`; updated overlay wiring in `src/main.js`, `index.html`, and telemetry helper `src/game/Game.js`.
- New procedural scaffolding: `src/game/procedural/TemplateVariantResolver.js`, `TilemapTransformer.js`, `CorridorSeamPainter.js`, plus refactored `src/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.js` and helper coverage `tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`.
- Documentation/backlog refresh: `docs/plans/backlog.md`; MCP backlog items `AUDIO-613`, `PROC-221` updated with progress and next steps.

---

## Verification
- `npm test` – 115 suites / 2077 tests passing (~27.9 s).

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Gameplay adaptive bridge (AUDIO-613)** – Need to validate quest-driven mood hints once additional triggers migrate and ensure overlay telemetry covers hint expiry cases.
2. **Act 1 trigger migration (QUEST-442)** – Vendor InteractionZone conversions, QuestSystem cleanup, and doc updates remain; keep an eye on registry seeding when reset utilities run.
3. **Tilemap fidelity (PROC-221)** – Populate variant manifests, implement seam painting, and capture rotation performance benchmarks before enabling rotated templates by default.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Validate mood hints via TriggerRegistry data and add regression coverage before closing AUDIO-613.
- Continue Act 1 trigger migration by converting vendor zones and trimming QuestSystem legacy paths.
- Flesh out rotation variants/seam painter logic and run generation benchmarks to gauge impact.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated MCP backlog items `AUDIO-613` and `PROC-221` with new completed work, refreshed next steps, and notes; mirrored status in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- No new backlog entries or architecture decisions required this session.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Completed three development tasks plus documentation/backlog/handoff updates — guardrails satisfied.
- Adaptive audio telemetry now surfaces suspicion/scrambler metrics in the overlay, easing designer tuning.
- Variant infrastructure is stubbed but inert; follow-up sessions must supply manifests and seam painting before rollout.
