# Autonomous Development Session #79 – Adaptive Emitters & Migration Foundations
**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h35m  
**Status**: Delivered Phase 1 implementations for adaptive mood emitters, Act 1 trigger migration tooling, and tile rotation math; updated backlog/docs and validated through Jest.

---

## Highlights
- Implemented gameplay-facing adaptive audio scaffolding (`SuspicionMoodMapper`, `AdaptiveMoodEmitter`) with Jest coverage and registered the emitter inside `Game.initializeAudioIntegrations()`.
- Authored `TriggerMigrationToolkit` + `QuestTriggerRegistry` to convert legacy InteractionZone flows, track outstanding migrations, and added regression tests.
- Introduced `TileRotationMatrix` utilities and tests to support rotated tilemap transforms for procedural rooms.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/audio/SuspicionMoodMapper.js`, `src/game/audio/AdaptiveMoodEmitter.js` with accompanying tests under `tests/game/audio/`.
- `src/game/quests/TriggerMigrationToolkit.js`, `src/game/quests/QuestTriggerRegistry.js` plus `tests/game/quests/*.test.js`.
- `src/engine/procedural/TileRotationMatrix.js` and `tests/engine/procedural/TileRotationMatrix.test.js`.
- Updated `src/game/Game.js` to instantiate mapper/emitter telemetry hooks; refreshed `tests/game/Game.systemRegistration.test.js`.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Session #79 progress notes mirrored for AUDIO-613, QUEST-442, PROC-221.

---

## Verification
- `npm test` (full suite) – initial run surfaced a flake (`BSPGenerator` performance <15 ms assertion at 17.8 ms); reran targeted `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/procedural/BSPGenerator.test.js` and it passed (<5 ms). All other suites green.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Gameplay adaptive bridge (AUDIO-613)** – Need to implement `GameplayAdaptiveAudioBridge` and wire Disguise/Firewall scrambler/combat events; integration tests still pending.
2. **Scene migrations (QUEST-442)** – Crime scene & vendor entities must consume the toolkit; QuestSystem cleanup + designer docs updates outstanding.
3. **Tilemap fidelity (PROC-221)** – Variant resolver, tilemap transformer, and corridor seam painter remain; monitor BSP performance flake threshold during future full-suite runs.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Extend adaptive audio work with bridge implementation and gameplay event wiring, then add telemetry/assertion coverage.
- Use `TriggerMigrationToolkit` to migrate the Act 1 crime scene trigger as a pilot and prune QuestSystem legacy paths.
- Integrate `TileRotationMatrix` into procedural generation (variant resolver + seam painter) and capture benchmarks.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated MCP backlog items `AUDIO-613`, `QUEST-442`, `PROC-221` to **in-progress** with notes/next steps; mirrored the same in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- No new backlog entries created; no architecture decisions required this session.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Completed three development tasks plus doc/handoff updates, satisfying autonomous run guardrails.
- Tests cover all new modules; documented BSPGenerator performance flake for awareness.
- No asset sourcing actions required this session.
