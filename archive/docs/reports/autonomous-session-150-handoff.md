# Autonomous Development Session #150 – District State Pipeline

**Date**: November 11, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 35m  
**Focus**: Stand up district data, persistence, and access evaluation to unblock progression gating.

---

## Summary
- Authored rich metadata definitions for Neon Districts, Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector, including stability, access rules, and environmental hooks.
- Expanded WorldStateStore with a dedicated district slice that tracks control changes, stability deltas, restrictions, and infiltration unlocks via new `district:*` events.
- Delivered `DistrictAccessEvaluator` utilities that surface unmet knowledge/quest/faction/ability/equipment blockers and translate active restrictions into human-readable blockers.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/data/districts/`
- `src/game/state/slices/districtSlice.js`
- `src/game/state/WorldStateStore.js`
- `src/game/progression/DistrictAccessEvaluator.js`
- `tests/game/data/districts/districts.test.js`
- `tests/game/state/districtSlice.test.js`
- `tests/game/progression/DistrictAccessEvaluator.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- district`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Integrate the district access evaluator with the travel/navigation UX to surface blockers and unlocked routes in-game.
2. Continue expanding `WorldStateStore` coverage for NPC state snapshots to fully satisfy `M3-013` acceptance criteria.
3. Carry forward: Re-run particle runtime stress tests once bespoke particle sheets arrive to validate throttling thresholds against final art.
4. Carry forward: Monitor the FX metrics Playwright scenario to ensure future cue additions keep deterministic sampler helpers intact.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Closed `M3-012: District Data Definitions` after landing metadata modules and validation tests.
- Logged world state slice updates against `M3-013` (status now **in-progress**) and documented changes in `docs/plans/backlog.md` under “Session #150 Backlog Updates”.
- Added and completed `M3-022: District Access Evaluation Utilities` for the new gating helpers.

---

## Notes
- District restrictions are now event-driven, so downstream systems can lock/unlock traversal without bespoke state stores.
- The evaluator supports contextual overrides for tooling/UI, enabling designers to simulate unlock conditions without mutating world state.
