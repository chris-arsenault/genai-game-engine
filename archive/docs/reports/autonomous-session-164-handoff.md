# Autonomous Development Session #164 – Automation Policy Alignment

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~50m  
**Focus**: Remove remaining manual QA/approval expectations from documentation and backlog; enforce generate-image usage for all asset requests.

## Summary
- Refreshed top-level docs (AGENTS manual, roadmap, backlog, asset inventory) to codify the automation-only mandate and eliminate instructions that required manual QA sweeps or external approvals.
- Updated high-priority backlog items (AR-050, AR-008, CORE-302, M3-016) so next steps rely entirely on automated pipelines and `mcp__generate-image__generate_image`, retiring bespoke scheduling and email-driven workflows.
- Noted legacy bespoke references in asset inventory as deprecated and highlighted the generate-image tool as the sole path for outstanding visual requests.

## Deliverables
- Documentation updates: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/plans/roadmap.md`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`.
- Backlog adjustments via MCP: AR-050, AR-008, CORE-302, M3-016 (automation-only next steps + notes).
- New session record: `docs/reports/autonomous-session-164-handoff.md` (this file).

## Verification
- No automated suites were run (documentation/backlog-only changes). Automation coverage remains expected via existing Jest/Playwright suites.

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups (Automation Only)
1. Extend `scripts/telemetry/distributeSaveLoadQa.js` + associated tests so Save/Load packets auto-ingest into the validator queue and surface schema/latency regressions without manual email.
2. Implement the adaptive audio generator workflow for AR-008 to emit tension/combat stems automatically and push metadata into `assets/music/requests.json`.
3. Ensure RenderOps lighting approvals run end-to-end through `scripts/art/packageRenderOpsLighting.js` and telemetry hooks, eliminating any narrative/RenderOps meeting dependencies.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- **AR-050**, **AR-008**, **CORE-302**, **M3-016**: Next steps rewritten to mandate automated tooling; notes clarify that manual QA, bespoke art queues, and external approvals are no longer acceptable.
- `AGENTS.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/plans/roadmap.md`, and `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` now explicitly forbid manual QA processes and require `mcp__generate-image__generate_image` for visual asset fulfillment.

## Assets & Media
- No new assets generated this session. All pending requests remain routed through `mcp__generate-image__generate_image` per the updated policy.
