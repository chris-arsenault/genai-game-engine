# Autonomous Development Session #83 – Quest Trigger Finalisation & Variant Manifest Expansion
**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h05m  
**Status**: Retired QuestSystem legacy polling, delivered Act 1 trigger authoring references, layered manifest-driven orientation variants, tightened procedural benchmarks, and reined in performance guards for forensic/faction/BSP suites.

---

## Highlights
- Removed QuestSystem's InteractionZone compatibility path so only registry-backed `Trigger` components drive quest flow, refreshed `tests/game/systems/QuestSystem.trigger.test.js`, and authored the designer cheat sheet (`docs/guides/act1-trigger-authoring.md`).
- Introduced a default variant manifest (`src/game/procedural/templates/authoredTemplates.js`) for Act 1 crime scenes and vendor bays, wired DistrictGenerator to consume it automatically, and extended integration tests to assert variant/seam metadata plus placement reporting.
- Captured fresh telemetry and tightened guard thresholds: Forensic analysis target <4 ms (observed ~1.28 ms), Faction reputation updates <2 ms (observed ~1.48 ms), attitude lookups <0.05 ms, and BSP generation <10 ms (observed ~4.07 ms).
- Re-benchmarked rotation impact with orientation variants enabled—average **28.86 ms** across three mixed-district seeds, providing a new baseline ahead of art drops.

## Deliverables
- Quest cleanup: `src/game/systems/QuestSystem.js`, `tests/game/systems/QuestSystem.trigger.test.js`, `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/guides/act1-trigger-authoring.md`.
- Procedural variants: `src/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.js`, `src/game/procedural/templates/authoredTemplates.js`, `tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`, `docs/guides/procedural-generation-integration.md`.
- Performance guard updates: `tests/game/systems/ForensicSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/FactionManager.test.js`, `tests/game/procedural/BSPGenerator.test.js`.
- Backlog documentation: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (status sync for QUEST-442 & PROC-221).

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/systems/QuestSystem.trigger.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/systems/ForensicSystem.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/FactionManager.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/procedural/BSPGenerator.test.js`
- Rotation benchmark (`node -e "import { performance } from 'node:perf_hooks'; import { DistrictGenerator } from './src/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.js'; const generator = new DistrictGenerator({ rotationAngles: [0, 90, 180, 270] }); const seeds = [11873, 22019, 45011]; const samples = seeds.map(seed => { const start = performance.now(); generator.generate(seed, 'mixed'); return performance.now() - start; }); const average = samples.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0)/samples.length; console.log(JSON.stringify({ samples, average }, null, 2));"`) → samples [52.71 ms, 20.87 ms, 13.01 ms], average **28.86 ms**.

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Broaden manifest coverage** – Only crime scene and vendor bays have authored variants. Extend the manifest to additional room families (detector office, alley hubs) once art/layout data is available.
2. **Quest trigger audit** – Verify remaining scenes (beyond Act 1) attach `Trigger` components before pruning any other QuestSystem fallbacks; add regression tests per scene as migrations roll out.
3. **Performance telemetry cadence** – The stricter thresholds rely on local runs; schedule hardware-specific sampling (especially for forensic analysis) to ensure CI variability still clears the updated caps.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Expand the variant manifest to other high-traffic templates and capture seam metadata for corridor painter coverage.
- Continue migrating scenes to the registry toolkit, adding focused Jest/Playwright coverage for newly converted trigger volumes.
- Wire a lightweight telemetry script for forensic/faction/BSP suites to watch for regressions under CI load.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- **QUEST-442** marked complete—QuestSystem cleanup landed, docs refreshed, and registry references published.
- **PROC-221** `completed_work` updated with manifest defaulting, integration tests, and the new rotation benchmark (28.86 ms).
- No new backlog items opened; performance guard tightening captured in session notes.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Rotation benchmark average: **28.86 ms** (seeds 11873 / 22019 / 45011).
- Forensic analysis perf sample: **1.28 ms** (threshold tightened to `<4 ms`).
- Faction reputation modify perf sample: **1.48 ms** (threshold tightened to `<2 ms`).
- BSP generation 100×100 sample: **4.07 ms** (threshold tightened to `<10 ms`).
- New documentation: `docs/guides/act1-trigger-authoring.md` for designers + updated procedural guide.
