# Autonomous Development Session #71 – Runtime Transcript Wiring & CI Upload Hardening

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h20m  
**Status**: Tutorial transcript capture now runs automatically during gameplay, CI uploads persist real `gh` results into telemetry manifests, and Playwright guards transcript content end-to-end.

---

## Highlights
- Wired `TutorialTranscriptRecorder` into the runtime bootstrap (`Game.initializeGameSystems`) so every session records tutorial events; cleanup now stops the recorder to avoid leaked listeners.
- Promoted `scripts/telemetry/providers/githubUpload.js` from a stub to a real GitHub CLI uploader with exit-code/STDIO capture and `ci-artifacts.json` provider result persistence, backed by new integration coverage.
- Deepened the tutorial Playwright suite to assert `tutorial_started`, `tutorial_step_completed`, and `tutorial_completed` across JSON/CSV/Markdown artifacts, ensuring transcript fidelity post-export.
- Updated technical + troubleshooting docs and backlog progress to reflect the hardened pipeline.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/Game.js` – Instantiate/start `TutorialTranscriptRecorder` during system initialization and stop it during cleanup.
- `tests/game/Game.tutorialTranscriptRecorder.test.js` – New regression suite validating runtime wiring, transcript capture, and cleanup unsubscription.
- `scripts/telemetry/providers/githubUpload.js` – Reworked provider: real `gh artifact upload`, skip handling, output truncation, metadata persistence, and exported helpers (CLI guard retained).
- `tests/integration/githubUploadProvider.test.js` – Covers dry-run skips, CLI missing, missing-asset failures, happy-path upload, and metadata persistence.
- `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` – Stronger assertions for transcript events and artifact content.
- Docs refreshed: `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/Game.tutorialTranscriptRecorder.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/integration/githubUploadProvider.test.js`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js --reporter=list --timeout=60000`

All suites passed; Playwright run confirmed transcript artifacts include the expected lifecycle events.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Surface provider result metrics (`providerResults` in `ci-artifacts.json`) within CI dashboards to spot upload regressions quickly.
2. Extend cascade mission Playwright scenarios to validate transcript ordering alongside cascade telemetry once new beats land.
3. Monitor GitHub CLI availability in CI runners; add fallback orchestration if runner images change.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Instrument telemetry dashboards (or CI summary logs) with the new provider metrics and confirm they show up in workflow summaries.
- Expand mission-focused Playwright coverage to assert transcript sequencing alongside cascade telemetry.
- Review remaining PO-002 observability acceptance items for closure criteria.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated PO-002 next steps to focus on provider metric surfacing and cascade mission transcript checks; recorded completed work for runtime wiring, provider hardening, and Playwright assertions.
- Documentation mirrors the new runtime wiring, provider behaviour, and automation expectations.

---

## Metrics
- Tutorial transcript summary now emits >20 entries per automated run, with explicit `tutorial_completed` finalization verified in automation.
- GitHub provider captures command exit codes and truncates STDIO to 2 kB per run; integration tests confirm skip/failure handling.
