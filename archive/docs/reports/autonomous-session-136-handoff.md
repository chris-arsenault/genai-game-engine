# Autonomous Development Session #136 – Collision Contact & Tutorial Witness Integration

**Date**: November 6, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h 00m  
**Focus**: Improve collision response fidelity, refresh investigation systems, and enrich the tutorial case with guided witness interactions.

---

## Summary
- Expanded narrow-phase collision detectors to return contact points and separation vectors while tightening validation coverage.
- Introduced a dedicated Investigation component, syncing abilities and detective vision state with the InvestigationSystem and extending evidence logging.
- Enriched "The Hollow Case" tutorial data with scene metadata, gated witness interviews, and automated dialogue registration plus integrity tests.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/engine/physics/collisionDetectors.js`, `tests/engine/physics/collisionDetectors.test.js`
- `src/game/components/Investigation.js`, `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js`, `tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js`
- `src/game/data/cases/tutorialCase.js`, `src/game/managers/CaseManager.js`, `src/game/scenes/TutorialScene.js`, `tests/game/data/cases/tutorialCase.test.js`
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/engine/physics/collisionDetectors.test.js tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js tests/game/data/cases/tutorialCase.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. MCP backlog entries for M1-013, M2-001, and M2-013 still need status updates—`search_backlog_semantic` failed with HTTP 404 (MCP service offline).
2. Sync `docs/plans/backlog.md` with MCP once the service is reachable to record today’s completions.
3. Schedule an end-to-end playtest to confirm the Martinez witness dialogue flows now that the tutorial witness spawns and unlocks dynamically.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` documents the collision contact metadata, investigation component integration, and tutorial witness expansion.
- MCP backlog update postponed—service unreachable during session; no local markdown changes made to avoid divergence.

---

## Notes
- Attempting to query `game-mcp-server/search_backlog_semantic` returned HTTP 404; backlog and handoff storage via MCP remain pending.
- Witness interaction prompts default to a locked message until `ev_001_extractor` is collected; adjust messaging after playtest feedback if players still approach Martinez early.
