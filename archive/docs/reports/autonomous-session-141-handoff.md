# Autonomous Development Session #141 – Quest & Forensic Overlay Cues

**Date**: November 10, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 15m  
**Focus**: Extend the FX overlay to respond to quest milestones and forensic analysis beats, wiring narrative/investigation systems into the shared cue pipeline.

---

## Summary
- Expanded `FxOverlay` with quest milestone pulses, quest completion bursts, and forensic scan/reveal renders so narrative/investigation beats surface through the HUD layer.
- Emitted `fx:overlay_cue` events from `QuestManager` (start/objective completion/quest completion) and `ForensicSystem` (availability/start/complete), passing contextual metadata to drive the new effects.
- Refreshed Jest coverage across FX, quest, and forensic suites to validate cue handling, event emission, and renderer behaviours.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/FxOverlay.js`
- `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js`
- `src/game/systems/ForensicSystem.js`
- Tests: `tests/game/ui/FxOverlay.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/ForensicSystem.test.js`
- Documentation: `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/ui/FxOverlay.test.js tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js tests/game/systems/ForensicSystem.test.js`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Coordinate FX cue styling with upcoming particle/visual layers to avoid visual collisions and enable composite treatments once particle systems land.
2. Evaluate real-scene performance once additional quest/forensic emitters are active concurrently; capture telemetry to ensure pulses stay within the 60 FPS budget.
3. Confirm other narrative systems (dialogue board, case log reveals) emit the new cue IDs as those features firm up.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Created and closed MCP backlog item `FX-235` capturing the quest/forensic overlay cue integration; mirrored the completion details in `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session #141).

---

## Notes
- Quest cue emissions include quest/objective metadata so future HUD copy or analytics consumers can react without re-querying quest state.
- Forensic cue payloads carry evidence/forensic type info, keeping downstream audio/particle consumers free to branch on the same metadata.
- New FX renderers avoid per-frame allocations and keep gradients/strokes cached per invocation to preserve existing overlay performance budgets.
