## Critical Blockers

### 1. CollisionSystem Component Type Collision (P0 - BLOCKING) ❌

**Problem**: Component base class uses `type` property, which conflicts with ECS component type identification. Physics system attempts to set `collider.type = 'aabb'` but Component.js expects `type` to be the component name.

**Impact**:
- 13 CollisionSystem unit tests failing
- Integration tests pass (system works, just can't test it properly)
- **BLOCKS M2**: Investigation mechanics require trigger zones (collision-based)

**Root Cause**: `src/engine/ecs/Component.js` line 5: `this.type = this.constructor.name`

**Solution**: Refactor to use `componentType` instead of `type`

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/engine/ecs/Component.js` (change property name)
- `src/engine/ecs/ComponentRegistry.js` (update references)
- `src/game/components/*.js` (update any direct type references)

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 hours
**Assigned To**: Engine developer

### 2. Logger.js Parse Error (P0 - BLOCKING) ❌

**Problem**: Syntax error in Logger.js prevents builds

**Impact**: Cannot build production version

**Solution**: Fix syntax error (likely missing bracket or quote)

**Estimated Fix Time**: 30 minutes
**Assigned To**: Any developer

### 3. Missing M1-024 Full Engine Integration Test (P1 - REQUIRED) ❌

**Problem**: No end-to-end test validating full engine working together

**Impact**:
- Cannot verify all systems integrate correctly
- Risk of regression when adding M2 features

**Solution**: Implement M1-024 as specified in backlog
- Create 500 entities with Transform, Sprite, Velocity, Collider
- Run for 1000 frames
- Measure FPS, memory, frame times
- Verify 60 FPS maintained

**Estimated Time**: 4 hours
**Assigned To**: Test engineer

### 4. Missing M1-025 Performance Profiling (P1 - REQUIRED) ❌

**Problem**: Performance targets not formally validated

**Impact**:
- Don't know if we meet "60 FPS with 500 sprites" target
- Don't know if entity creation meets "<100ms for 10,000 entities" target

**Solution**: Implement M1-025 as specified
- Profile with Chrome DevTools
- Identify hotspots (>10% frame time)
- Memory profiling (heap snapshots)
- Document findings

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours
**Assigned To**: Optimizer

## Coverage Gaps

### Test Coverage Below Targets

**Overall**: 50.84% (need 60%)
**Engine**: 72.85% (need 80%)

**Modules with 0% coverage**:
- `src/engine/ecs/Entity.js` - Base entity class
- `src/engine/ecs/Component.js` - Base component class
- `src/engine/ecs/System.js` - Base system class (only tested through subclasses)

**Modules below 80% (engine)**:
- CollisionSystem: 51.49% (failing tests)
- AssetLoader: 71.65% (branches not fully covered)

**Recommendation**: Add 3-4 hours of base class unit tests

---

## Code Quality Issues

### Linting Errors

**Total Issues**: 128 (70 errors, 58 warnings)

**Critical Issues**:
- Logger.js parse error (blocking)
- 15 "console.log" usage (should use Logger)
- 12 unused variables

**Resolution**:
1. Fix Logger.js parse error (30 min)
2. Run `npm run lint -- --fix` (automated)
3. Manually fix remaining 20-30 issues (2 hours)

| Rendering <8ms | 3-5ms | ✅ |
| Physics <4ms | 2-3ms | ✅ |

### Targets Not Validated ⚠️

## Sprint 2 Readiness Assessment

### Current Status: **CONDITIONAL GO** ⚠️

**Blocker Resolution Required**: YES

**Critical Path**:
1. Fix CollisionSystem (BLOCKING M2 investigation mechanics)
2. Fix Logger.js (BLOCKING builds)
3. Complete M1-024 (REQUIRED for M1 sign-off)
4. Complete M1-025 (REQUIRED for M1 sign-off)

**After Fixes**:
- Sprint 2 can proceed
- M2 (Investigation Mechanics) requires working collision system
- Investigation zones use trigger components (collision-based)

**Recommendation**:
```
CONDITIONAL GO - ALLOCATE 2 DAYS FOR FIXES

DO NOT start Sprint 2 until:
✅ CollisionSystem tests passing
✅ Build succeeds
✅ M1-024 complete
✅ M1-025 complete

After fixes, project is ready for M2.
```

## Key Takeaways

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Agent Coordination**: 5 specialized agents worked in parallel effectively
2. **Test Discipline**: 97.6% pass rate, most modules well-tested
3. **Performance**: GameLoop and spatial hash exceeded targets
4. **Architecture**: ECS pattern properly implemented, clean separation
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive reports for all major work
6. **MCP Usage**: 10 new patterns stored for future consistency

### What Needs Improvement ⚠️

1. **Component Design**: Type property collision should have been caught earlier
2. **Integration Testing**: Should have implemented M1-024 during development
3. **Coverage Monitoring**: Base classes slipped through without tests
4. **Code Quality**: Linting should run automatically in CI
5. **Performance Validation**: M1-025 should have been done incrementally

### Lessons Learned 📚

1. **Test early, test often**: CollisionSystem issues found late
2. **Base classes need tests**: Entity, Component, System all 0% coverage
3. **Automated quality gates**: Need pre-commit hooks for linting
4. **Integration tests crucial**: Unit tests alone aren't sufficient
5. **Performance baselines**: Need M1-025 metrics before optimizing
