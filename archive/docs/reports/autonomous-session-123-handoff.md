# Autonomous Development Session #123 – Spatial Telemetry Export & Infiltration HUD Hooks

**Date**: November 16, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 50m  
**Focus**: Persist spatial hash telemetry history into SaveManager exports, harden exporter sanitization, and extend infiltration Playwright coverage to assert HUD metrics.

---

## Summary
- Wired the collision system into SaveManager so inspector exports now carry spatial hash rolling history; added `SpatialHash.getMetricsHistorySnapshot()` and exporter sanitization to keep telemetry payloads bounded.
- Confirmed the 120-frame default metrics window remains the best performance/value trade-off and recorded the decision in backlog notes.
- Augmented the Memory Parlor infiltration Playwright fixture with debug HUD spatial assertions, ensuring stealth patrol density is validated inside narrative-critical scenes.
- Synchronized backlog (`M1-012`, `M1-002`) and documentation with the new telemetry/export workflow updates.

---

## Deliverables
- **Engine / Telemetry**
  - `src/engine/physics/SpatialHash.js`: Added `getMetricsHistorySnapshot()` for safe rolling history snapshots.
  - `src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`: Registered collision-system telemetry provider and added spatial metrics snapshot plumbing + sanitization.
  - `src/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.js`: Exporter now serializes spatial hash aggregates/history with numeric coercion and payload estimates.
- **QA / Testing**
  - `tests/engine/physics/SpatialHash.test.js`: Coverage for history snapshot API.
  - `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js`: Verified sanitized telemetry exports and history persistence.
  - `tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js`: New debug overlay spatial hash assertions inside the infiltration flow.
- **Documentation**
  - `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Logged Session #123 updates for M1-002/M1-012 and refreshed next-session focus.

---

## Verification
- `npm test`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Assess QuestManager for proactive NPC availability notifications to close the remaining `M1-002` review task.
2. Secure RenderOps + narrative approval on the neon signage glow pass to unblock AR-050 closure.
3. Monitor inspector export payload sizes once CI/QA pipelines consume the new spatial history to ensure downstream tooling tolerances remain comfortable.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `M1-012` marked **done** with Session 123 telemetry exporter integration noted; next steps cleared.
- `M1-002` retains the QuestManager audit as the sole next step and now lists the infiltration HUD assertions in completed work.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` records the new telemetry/export deliverables for Session 123 and updates the coming-session focus list.

---

## Notes
- Retaining the 120-frame metrics window keeps inspector payloads ~9.8 KB while the exporter sanitization now enforces numeric coercion and history trimming safeguards.
- Spatial hash telemetry history is now accessible to QA without mutating runtime samples, reducing the risk of profiling-driven regressions during stealth benchmarks.
