# Autonomous Development Session #51 – Tutorial ECS Alignment

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h35m (Start ≈2025-10-29T07:05:00Z – End ≈2025-10-29T08:40:00Z)  
**Status**: Tutorial blocker resolved; backlog updated; ECS integration test added.

---

## Executive Summary
- Rewired the tutorial scene to use the modern ECS factories for evidence and player entities, restoring `evidence:detected` emissions so the tutorial overlay advances past step 3.
- Enhanced the reusable evidence factory to respect custom prompts and normalize ability requirements, keeping stealth/intel encounters consistent across scenes.
- Added a Jest integration test covering tutorial evidence detection to prevent regressions and logged the incident in the backlog with follow-up guidance.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Tutorial ECS migration**: `TutorialScene` now spawns evidence via `createEvidenceEntity`, maintains entity IDs through a map, and subscribes to detection events for visual feedback.
- **Factory improvements**: `createEvidenceEntity` now accepts optional prompts and coerces ability requirements, ensuring consistent interaction zones in other scenes.
- **Regression coverage**: New test `tests/game/scenes/TutorialScene.test.js` validates that evidence within range triggers `evidence:detected`, guarding the tutorial flow.
- **Backlog traceability**: Logged tutorial failure as `TUT-201` (P0, completed) within `docs/plans/backlog.md` so future audits capture the fix.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- TutorialScene`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Manual tutorial QA**: Run the full tutorial scenario in-browser to visually confirm prompt progression and clue derivations now that ECS wiring is in place.
2. **AUDIO-351 (P0)**: Still top priority for next session—validate live combat/disguise audio routing with gameplay-triggered events.
3. **PERF-214 / UX-173**: Browser profiling and debug overlay ergonomics remain open; schedule once tutorial smoke validation passes.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 6 (Tutorial scene, evidence factory, backlog, changelog, new test, session report)
- **New Tests**: 1 integration test (`TutorialScene` detection coverage)
- **Tests Run**: `npm test -- TutorialScene`

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Kick off `AUDIO-351` combat/disguise trigger validation (per backlog mandate).
- Schedule manual tutorial playthrough alongside telemetry capture to confirm regression fix.
- Queue profiling pass (`PERF-214`) once tutorial + combat proofs are captured.
