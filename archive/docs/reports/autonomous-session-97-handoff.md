# Autonomous Development Session #97 - Crossroads Manifest QA & Telemetry Reporting  
**Date**: November 12, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h20m  
**Status**: Act 2 Crossroads art overrides support manifest drops, branch interiors emit dialogue telemetry under regression, and validation harness outputs dashboard-ready summaries.

---

## Highlights
- Delivered a placeholder Act 2 Crossroads palette plus manifest-aware loader so bespoke art packages can ship without scene code changes.
- Added cross-branch dialogue integration coverage, proving each interior fires `interaction:dialogue` on quest area entry.
- Extended `QuestTelemetryValidationHarness` with dashboard report generation to prep analytics ingestion.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/data/sceneArt/Act2CrossroadsArtConfig.js`, `src/game/config/GameConfig.js` – new placeholder art configuration wired through `GameConfig.sceneArt.act2Crossroads`.
- `src/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.js` – manifest-aware art resolution, AssetLoader reuse, sanitised metadata, and fallback preservation when overrides are sparse.
- `tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.artOverrides.test.js` – regression covering both local config and remote manifest flows.
- `tests/game/scenes/Act2BranchDialogueIntegration.test.js` – ensures corporate, resistance, and personal interiors emit the correct branch dialogues once per objective.
- `src/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.dashboard.test.js` – dashboard reporting utilities with coverage for expected tag/objective gaps.
- Docs: updated `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.artOverrides.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2BranchDialogueIntegration.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.dashboard.test.js`
- `npm test` *(fails on existing BSPGenerator performance threshold – 12.25 ms > 10 ms target; no new regressions surfaced)*

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Crossroads art package delivery** – Await bespoke asset drop; once received, populate manifest JSON + textures and rerun hub layout/navigation suites.
2. **Narrative polish** – Partner with narrative team for final copy/VO review on Act 2 branch objective dialogue, updating docs/tests if lines shift.
3. **Telemetry dashboards** – Feed the new report output into live analytics dashboards after warehouse refresh to confirm schema parity.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Import the Crossroads art bundle via manifest overrides, validate rendering, and exercise hub regression suites.
- Facilitate narrative copy/VO review for branch objective dialogues; log any follow-up tasks.
- Connect dashboard reports to production analytics, adjusting tag schemas if mismatches appear.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated `QUEST-610` with Session 97 progress (manifest loader, dialogue QA, telemetry dashboard reporting) and refreshed next steps to focus on final art drop, narrative polish, and analytics integration.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` remains aligned with MCP priorities highlighting Crossroads art delivery and telemetry dashboard verification.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Placeholder art config keeps all boundary colliders intact while tinting hub surfaces; manifest fallback retains defaults when overrides are partial.
- New regression suites guard both manifest ingestion and dialogue emission to prevent silent regressions across Act 2 interiors.
- Dashboard report summarises observed tags, quest/objective coverage, and issue breakdowns so analytics dashboards can highlight gaps immediately.
