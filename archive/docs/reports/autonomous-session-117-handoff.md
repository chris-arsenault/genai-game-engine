# Autonomous Development Session #117 – Share-Ready RenderOps Bundles & Telemetry Calendar Alerts

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h  
**Status**: RenderOps packets now ship with checksummed archives and delivery manifests, placeholder audits rank bespoke art priorities, and telemetry reminders emit alert-driven calendar invites.

---

## Summary
- Extended `RenderOpsPacketBuilder` to emit share-ready ZIP archives, delivery manifests, and share manifests so RenderOps receives actionable metadata with checksum verification in every packet.
- Enhanced placeholder auditing with a prioritized replacement plan (`reports/art/placeholder-replacement-plan.(json|md)`) that scores AR-001 – AR-005 bespoke assets by urgency, missing files, and manifest context.
- Upgraded telemetry cadence reminders with alert levels, proactive messaging, and automated `.ics` calendar invites generated via `npm run telemetry:reminder` to keep analytics checkpoints visible.

---

## Deliverables
- **Engine/Tooling**: Updated `src/game/tools/RenderOpsPacketBuilder.js`, `PlaceholderAudit.js`, and `TelemetryScheduleReminder.js` plus CLI scripts (`scripts/art/packageRenderOpsLighting.js`, `scripts/art/auditPlaceholderAssets.js`, `scripts/telemetry/remindParitySchedule.js`).
- **Reports & Artifacts**: Share-ready RenderOps packets now include `<label>.zip`, `share-manifest.json`, and `<label>-delivery.json`; placeholder audit pipeline emits `reports/art/placeholder-replacement-plan.json` and `.md`; telemetry reminder produces `reports/telemetry/parity-schedule-reminder.ics` alongside JSON/Markdown.
- **Docs & Backlog**: Updated `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` and `docs/plans/backlog.md`; backlog items `AR-050` and `TEL-021` refreshed with the new automation steps and next actions.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- RenderOpsPacketBuilder`
- `npm test -- PlaceholderAudit`
- `npm test -- TelemetryScheduleReminder`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Deliver the latest RenderOps packet (ZIP + `<label>-delivery.json` manifest) to RenderOps, capture feedback on actionable segments, and regenerate after art revisions.
2. Use `reports/art/placeholder-replacement-plan.md` to schedule bespoke replacements for AR-001 – AR-005 and update manifests/licensing on approval.
3. Share `reports/telemetry/parity-schedule-reminder.ics` with analytics stakeholders and monitor reminder `alerts` for warning/critical escalations; adjust `--warning-days` if earlier notice is required.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `AR-050` completed work expanded with share-ready archives and replacement plan; next steps emphasize delivering packet manifests and using the prioritized plan.
- `TEL-021` captures alert-level + calendar invite automation with refreshed next steps for distributing the `.ics` asset.
- Docs synced: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` documents the new packet/plan tooling; `docs/plans/backlog.md` logs Session #117 updates.

---

## Notes
- Replacement plan ranks assets by missing files, placeholder age, and bespoke keywords; use it to seed sprint art blocks.
- RenderOps delivery manifest includes SHA-256 checksum for ZIP validation and highlights actionable segments for quick triage.
- Reminder ICS uses a default one-hour window with alarms (`>= 60` minutes) based on the configured warning threshold.
