# Autonomous Development Session #70 – Tutorial Transcript Exports & CI Provider Hooks

**Date**: November 1, 2025  \
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  \
**Session Duration**: ~1h30m  \
**Status**: Tutorial transcript artifacts now ship alongside cascade telemetry, CI command hooks execute via a GitHub upload stub, and Playwright automation validates transcript availability end-to-end.

---

## Highlights
- Extended `createInspectorExportArtifacts()` to emit tutorial transcript CSV/Markdown files, introduced flexible format aliases, and refreshed Jest/integration coverage to expect five artifacts per export.
- Updated GitHub Actions telemetry stage to request transcript formats and execute `scripts/telemetry/providers/githubUpload.js`, a provider hook that attempts `gh` uploads while safely degrading during local runs.
- Enhanced Playwright telemetry helper defaults (JSON/CSV + transcript artifacts) and added tutorial overlay assertions that confirm transcript exports are generated during automated onboarding flows.
- Refreshed documentation/backlog to capture the new export pipeline, helper usage, and upcoming runtime recorder wiring work.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.js` – transcript format aliasing, CSV/Markdown artifact generation, and timestamped filenames.
- `tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js`, `tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js` – expectations updated for transcript artifacts and CI manifest counts (5 files).
- `tests/e2e/utils/telemetryArtifacts.js`, `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` – helper defaults to transcript exports, new tutorial transcript assertions, attachment toggles.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/ci/telemetry-commands.json`, `scripts/telemetry/providers/githubUpload.js` – CI telemetry stage requests transcript formats and executes provider upload stub.
- `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md` – documentation/backlog aligned with transcript exports and provider wiring.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js --reporter=list --timeout=60000`
- `node scripts/telemetry/providers/githubUpload.js` (manual smoke; warns when metadata absent, exits 0)

Playwright run confirms transcript artifacts attach in tutorial automation; Jest suites validate exporter outputs and CI manifest counts.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Runtime transcript wiring** – Instantiate/start `TutorialTranscriptRecorder` during game bootstrap so non-automation sessions populate transcripts (currently empty unless recorder manually started).
2. **Provider uploads** – Replace GitHub CLI stub with real artifact uploads once credentials/path validation is complete; record exit metrics in `ci-artifacts.json`.
3. **Transcript content assertions** – After recorder wiring, deepen Playwright checks to assert presence of key events (e.g., tutorial completion) across flows.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Hook the transcript recorder into the runtime dependency container and ensure tutorial flows trigger `start()`/`stop()` appropriately.
- Expand `githubUpload` provider script to execute real `gh artifact upload` (with configurable switches) and surface exit codes in CI logs.
- Broaden Playwright coverage to validate transcript content once runtime wiring is complete (cascade mission + tutorial).

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated backlog item `PO-002` with completed transcript export work, CI provider stub, and Playwright helper assertions; queued follow-ups for runtime recorder wiring, provider hardening, and deeper transcript validations.

---

## Metrics
- Exporter test suite now expects **5 artifacts** per run (`json`, `cascade csv`, `tutorial csv`, `transcript csv`, `transcript md`).
- Integration telemetry export writes `ci-artifacts.json` with **5 artifact entries** and executes configured CI commands without errors.
- Tutorial Playwright automation completes in ~5.0 s locally while producing transcript artifacts alongside existing cascade telemetry outputs.
