# Autonomous Development Session #105 - Solo Workflow Realignment
**Date**: October 30, 2025  \
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  \
**Session Duration**: ~1h50m  \
**Status**: Solo development workflow adopted; narrative review tooling shifted to note-based self review; asset sourcing backlog formalized.

---

## Highlights
- Updated project instructions and backlog artifacts to emphasise single-developer execution with no external approval gates.
- Refactored the Act 2 dialogue bundle CLI to record timestamped self-review notes (instead of reviewer approvals) and refreshed accompanying documentation + samples.
- Created high-priority asset sourcing backlog item (AR-050) to drive visual asset acquisition via web_search or OpenAI image generation requests.

---

## Deliverables
- Narrative tooling: `scripts/narrative/bundleAct2BranchDialoguesForReview.js`, `tests/scripts/bundleAct2BranchDialoguesForReview.test.js`, `telemetry-artifacts/review/act2-branch-dialogues/2025-11-12-review/review-manifest.json`, `telemetry-artifacts/review/act2-branch-dialogues/2025-11-12-review/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Documentation: `docs/guides/act2-dialogue-review-workflow.md`, `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/plans/project-overview.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Backlog hygiene: Added MCP backlog item `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` (id `3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`) and synced local backlog overview.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- bundleAct2BranchDialoguesForReview`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Asset sourcing pipeline** – Execute AR-050: inventory outstanding manifests, run web_search/OpenAI sourcing attempts, and update metadata with licensing notes.
2. **RenderOps hardware validation** – Re-run Crossroads lighting presets in-engine to confirm no hotspot regressions flagged by the validator.
3. **Analytics ingestion follow-up** – Confirm analytics team (self) processes `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/outbox/act2-crossroads-20251112` before queuing the next telemetry parity run.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Kick off AR-050 by cataloguing unresolved image manifests and drafting sourcing attempts.
- Schedule Crossroads lighting verification pass and capture any threshold adjustments needed post hardware test.
- Check analytics inbox/process logs to ensure the latest parity package is ingested, then prep the next telemetry dispatch label.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Logged AR-050 (P0) for visual asset sourcing; backlog table updated to reflect solo-review workflow.
- Backlog guidance now lists solo developer structure; documentation cross-references updated guides.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Narrative review manifest now maintains timestamped self-review notes (no approvals array).
- Checklist template emphasises note logging + backlog updates over external sign-offs.
