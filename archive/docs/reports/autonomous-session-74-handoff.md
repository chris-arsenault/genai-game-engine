# Autonomous Development Session #74 – Telemetry Upload Actions Fallback
**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h25m  
**Status**: Actions API fallback keeps telemetry artifacts flowing when `gh` goes missing; guardrails stay green.

---

## Highlights
- Introduced `GitHubActionsArtifactFallback`, wiring `@actions/artifact` into `CiArtifactPublisher` so metadata persistence and EventsBus telemetry continue even when CLI commands fail.
- Upgraded `scripts/telemetry/providers/githubUpload.js` to chain the new fallback after CLI checks, capturing provenance in `ci-artifacts.json` and expanding unit/integration coverage for skip, failure, and recovery paths.
- Re-ran observability guardrails (WorldStateStore dispatch mean 0.0108 ms; telemetry writer mean 0.82 ms) to verify the additional plumbing stays within the 0.25 ms dispatch budget.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/telemetry/GitHubActionsArtifactFallback.js` – GitHub Actions artifact uploader with environment guards, telemetry logging, and provider-style result payloads.
- `src/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.js` – Fallback orchestration, metadata enrichment, and Actions API integration hooks.
- `scripts/telemetry/providers/githubUpload.js` – CLI → Actions API fallback pipeline, persisted transport metadata, and enhanced provider result reporting.
- `scripts/telemetry/exportInspectorTelemetry.js` – Default fallback wiring for CLI runs triggered via `npm run export-telemetry`.
- New/updated tests: `tests/game/telemetry/GitHubActionsArtifactFallback.test.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.test.js`, `tests/integration/githubUploadProvider.test.js`, `tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js`.
- Documentation updates in `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` and `docs/plans/backlog.md`; MCP backlog `PO-002` progress + architecture decision recorded.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/GitHubActionsArtifactFallback.test.js tests/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.test.js tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js tests/integration/githubUploadProvider.test.js`
- `node benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js`
- `node benchmarks/telemetry-export-writer.js`

All targeted suites and benchmarks passed; dispatch latency remains below guardrail.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Monitor telemetry provider metrics for repeated Actions API fallbacks or rate limits; surface alerts if uploads routinely bypass the CLI.
2. Evaluate extending the fallback to non-GitHub environments (self-hosted runners / object storage) to keep exporters portable.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Review CI telemetry summaries to confirm fallback usage stays rare and step summaries still reflect provider outcomes.
- Prototype portable uploader configuration (e.g., S3/MinIO) so the exporter can degrade gracefully outside GitHub-hosted runners.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- `PO-002` updated with fallback milestone completion, new follow-up steps, and refreshed guardrail metrics.
- Architecture decision logged: “Adopt GitHub Actions artifact fallback for telemetry exports.”

---

## Metrics & Notes
- WorldStateStore dispatch mean: **0.0108 ms** (threshold 0.25 ms)  
- Telemetry writer benchmark mean: **0.82 ms** (target <10 ms per artifact)  
- Provider metadata now records `transport`, `fallbackAttempted`, and `fallbackDetails` for Actions API executions.
