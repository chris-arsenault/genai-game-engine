# Autonomous Development Session #161 – Save/Load QA Distribution & Asset Routing

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 10m  
**Focus**: Stage a share-ready Save/Load QA delivery pipeline and resolve the outstanding asset routing decision for the Kira evasion animation pack.

## Summary
- Built `SaveLoadQADistributor` tooling plus CLI surfaces so QA receives packaged latency/payload artifacts with manifest + feedback tracker, and staged the current packet under `deliveries/qa/save-load/save-load/save-load-distribution-2025-10-31T04-42-21-907Z/`.
- Formalised asset request status updates with a reusable helper + CLI, then routed `image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack` to bespoke production after OpenAI generation was blocked by organization verification requirements.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/tools/SaveLoadQADistributor.js`, `scripts/telemetry/distributeSaveLoadQa.js`, and `tests/game/tools/SaveLoadQADistributor.test.js`.
- Share package: `deliveries/qa/save-load/save-load/save-load-distribution-2025-10-31T04-42-21-907Z/` (manifest, handoff readme, QA feedback tracker, archive copy).
- `src/game/tools/AssetRequestStatus.js`, `scripts/art/decideAssetRouting.js`, and `tests/game/tools/AssetRequestStatus.test.js`.
- Updated manifests/docs: `assets/images/requests.json`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/reports/save-load-qa-share-2025-10-31.md`.

## Verification
- `npm test -- SaveLoadQADistributor`
- `node scripts/telemetry/distributeSaveLoadQa.js --recipient=qa@thememorysyndicate.local`
- `npm test -- AssetRequestStatus`
- `node scripts/art/decideAssetRouting.js --id=image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack --status=bespoke-pending --route=bespoke`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Email the QA distribution list with the staged delivery contents and capture receipt in `deliveries/qa/save-load/.../qa-feedback-tracker.md`.
2. Record schema validation feedback from QA in the tracker and mirror any required adjustments back into backlog item M3-016.
3. Coordinate with the bespoke art scheduler to slot production time for `image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack` now that it is routed away from OpenAI generation.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated **M3-016** via MCP: added distribution automation/bespoke routing to `completed_work`, refreshed `next_steps`, and appended notes describing the new delivery location and asset status change.
- Logged Session #161 progress in `docs/plans/backlog.md` and annotated the QA share report with the distribution directory.

## Assets & Media
- Attempted OpenAI generation for `image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack`, but `mcp__game-mcp-server__generate_image` returned a 403 (organization verification required). Asset now routed to bespoke animation sprint with status `bespoke-pending`; manifest updated accordingly.
