# Autonomous Development Session #192 – Investigation Persistence

**Date**: 2025-11-02  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~65m  
**Focus**: Close the investigation persistence gap by wiring serialization into the ECS stack, keep art telemetry queues clear, and sync planning artifacts.

## Summary
- Re-ran `monitorRenderOpsApprovals` and telemetry acknowledgement scripts to confirm no new Act 2 Crossroads RenderOps follow-ups before beginning feature work.
- Implemented save/load serialization plumbing across `InvestigationSystem` and the `Investigation` component so collected evidence metadata, detective vision state, and ability unlocks survive SaveManager cycles.
- Authored targeted Jest coverage to exercise the new serialization/deserialization paths and executed the suite (`npm test -- InvestigationSystem`) to guard regressions.
- Promoted backlog item M2-001 to ready-for-review with notes on runtime verification, and mirrored the change in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/components/Investigation.js` — added ability-casefile deserializers plus serialization helpers.
- `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js` — introduced `_getInvestigationComponent()`, `serialize()`, and `deserialize()` with detective vision/state sanitization.
- `tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js` — new serialization/deserialization coverage for investigation state persistence.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — M2-001 status updated with latest progress summary.

## Verification
- `node scripts/art/monitorRenderOpsApprovals.js --markdown`
- `npm run telemetry:ack -- --format=json`
- `npm test -- InvestigationSystem`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. **AR-050** – Monitor RenderOps feedback channels for the 2025-10-31 packet and regenerate if revisions land before the 2025-11-07 bespoke sweep.
2. **AR-050 / M3-016** – Run `npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2` and recheck telemetry outbox during the 2025-11-07 automation window, logging any new autosave or lighting acknowledgements immediately.
3. **UX-410** – Execute `node scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.js --label autosave-20251107` on 2025-11-07 and archive the resulting summaries.
4. Continue standard telemetry parity monitoring; import RenderOps feedback into `reports/art/renderops-feedback.json` if new notes arrive.
5. **M2-001** – Exercise a full runtime save/load cycle (Autosave + manual load) to confirm CaseFileUI reflects restored evidence metadata and detective vision HUD signals the deserialized energy/cooldown state.
