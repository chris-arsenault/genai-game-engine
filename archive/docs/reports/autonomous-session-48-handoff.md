# Autonomous Development Session #48 – Adaptive Audio Telemetry & SFX Preview Tooling

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h10m (Start 2025-10-29T02:30:00Z – End 2025-10-29T03:40:16Z)  
**Status**: Adaptive mix stems generated, debug telemetry surfaced, SFX catalog expanded with investigative cues.

---

## Executive Summary
- Produced procedural tension/combat stems (`goodnightmare-tension.wav`, `goodnightmare-combat.wav`) and wired them through adaptive music configuration, manifest entries, and tests so Memory Parlor mixes now leverage distinct layers.
- Expanded the SFX catalog with investigation-focused cues plus a debug overlay preview UI, giving narrative/audio designers one-click auditioning and metadata visibility.
- Instrumented adaptive audio telemetry end-to-end: `AdaptiveMusicLayerController` now emits initial state events, `Game` captures history, and the overlay displays live transitions with timestamps.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Adaptive stems + state table**: Updated `AmbientSceneAudioController`, `GameConfig`, `MemoryParlorScene`, and manifest/catalog metadata to leverage new tension/combat stems while keeping ambient fallback resilience.
- **Debug audio tooling**: Extended `index.html`/`main.js` overlay to show adaptive state and an interactive SFX catalog list; exposed `Game.getSfxCatalogEntries()/previewSfx()` backed by new Jest coverage (`tests/game/audio/GameAudioTelemetry.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js` additions).
- **Catalog growth**: Added procedural investigation cues (`investigation-clue-ping.wav`, `investigation-trace-loop.wav`, `investigation-negative-hit.wav`) with CC0 self-authored notes and loader integration.
- **Documentation refresh**: Brought `CHANGELOG.md`, adaptive/audio system plans, and backlog status (`AUDIO-307` now in-progress) up to date with telemetry/preview deliverables.

---

## Verification
- `npm test`

All suites pass (84 total).

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Combat event wiring**: Adaptive mix still needs dedicated combat/disguise event triggers and Playwright coverage (remain under `AUDIO-307`).
2. **Telemetry stress validation**: No profiling yet on rapid scrambler/combat toggles; schedule gain ramp stability checks.
3. **Catalog UI polish**: Consider lightweight search/filtering once catalog grows beyond current entries.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 20 (audio engine/game, debug UI, docs, assets)
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 3 suites touched (`GameAudioTelemetry.test.js` new; ambient controller + overlays extended)
- **Assets Added**: 5 (2 music stems, 3 investigation SFX cues)

---

## Asset Sourcing Notes
- **Procedural stems (CC0 original)**: Generated in-session via Node PCM synthesis for tension/combat layers; documented in `assets/music/requests.json`.
- **Investigation SFX (CC0 original)**: Generated sine/noise sweeps recorded under `assets/sfx/investigation/` with catalog entries capturing creation method.
