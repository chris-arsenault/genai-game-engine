# Autonomous Development Session #155 – Manual Save/Load Workflow

**Date**: 2025-11-10  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 20m  
**Focus**: Deliver manual Save/Load slot workflows with slot enforcement and a player-facing overlay tied into the EventBus/control binding stack.

## Summary
- Normalized SaveManager slot identifiers, enforced manual slot capacity limits, and added slot metadata helpers/accessors to support downstream workflows.
- Introduced the Save/Load overlay with manual save and load actions, FX cue emissions, and refreshed key binding prompts so players can manage slots in runtime.
- Expanded Jest coverage for slot enforcement and the new overlay interactions while syncing backlog/docs for M3-016 progress.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`
- `src/game/ui/SaveLoadOverlay.js`
- `src/game/Game.js`
- `src/game/config/Controls.js`
- `src/game/ui/ControlBindingsOverlay.js`
- `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`
- `tests/game/ui/SaveLoadOverlay.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- `docs/reports/autonomous-session-155-handoff.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js tests/game/ui/SaveLoadOverlay.test.js`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Profile Save/Load latency with representative world state snapshots to confirm the <2s load-time acceptance criterion.
2. Exercise the new Save/Load overlay under autosave and stress scenarios to validate UX flow, focus cues, and slot eviction heuristics.
3. Review enriched save payloads with QA/telemetry consumers before freezing schema updates for downstream tooling.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated backlog item `M3-016` with slot workflow progress, refreshed next steps, and noted the Save/Load overlay deliverable.
- Logged Session #155 changes in `docs/plans/backlog.md` with verification notes.

## Notes
- Added a `saveLoad` binding (default `L`) so manual slot management can be toggled alongside existing overlays; SaveLoad overlay emits FX cues and overlay visibility events for coordination.
- Autosave flows remain intact and now benefit from the same metadata enforcement and slot normalization applied to manual saves.
