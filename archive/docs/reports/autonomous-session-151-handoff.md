# Autonomous Development Session #151 – Travel UX Integration & NPC State Snapshots

**Date**: November 12, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 45m  
**Focus**: Surface district access blockers inside the travel UX and expand WorldStateStore coverage to NPC lifecycle events for M3-013.

---

## Summary
- Implemented `DistrictTravelOverlay` with a shared view model so the travel/navigation HUD visualises blockers, restrictions, and unlocked routes from `DistrictAccessEvaluator`.
- Added a dedicated `npcSlice` plus EventBus wiring, snapshots, and hydration to capture NPC recognition, suspicion, alert, and interview state within WorldStateStore.
- Extended automated coverage (helper + slice + store tests) and refreshed backlog/docs to reflect the new travel UX integration and world-state capabilities.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/DistrictTravelOverlay.js`
- `src/game/ui/helpers/districtTravelViewModel.js`
- `src/game/state/slices/npcSlice.js`
- `src/game/state/WorldStateStore.js`
- `src/game/config/Controls.js`
- `src/game/Game.js`
- `tests/game/ui/helpers/districtTravelViewModel.test.js`
- `tests/game/state/npcSlice.test.js`
- `tests/game/state/worldStateStore.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- districtTravelViewModel npcSlice worldStateStore`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Hook DistrictTravelOverlay into movement-blocked/navigation events (and add Playwright coverage) so blockers surface automatically when traversal is denied.
2. Finalise WorldStateManager/SaveManager parity tests now that NPC + district slices participate in snapshots.
3. Carry forward: Re-run particle runtime stress tests once bespoke particle sheets arrive to validate throttling thresholds against final art.
4. Carry forward: Monitor the FX metrics Playwright scenario to ensure future cue additions keep deterministic sampler helpers intact.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `M3-022: District Access Evaluation Utilities` – noted travel overlay integration and telemetry follow-up.
- `M3-013: WorldStateManager Implementation` – recorded new NPC slice, event wiring, and tests; updated next steps to focus on SaveManager parity.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – added Session #151 updates summarising travel UX integration and NPC world state coverage.

---

## Notes
- DistrictTravelOverlay bindings default to `T` (configurable) and exposes overlay state snapshots for debugging/telemetry consumers.
- NPC slice history is capped at 10 events; adjust `HISTORY_LIMIT` if future analytics require deeper timelines.
