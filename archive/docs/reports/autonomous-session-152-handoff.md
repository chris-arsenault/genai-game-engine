# Autonomous Development Session #152 – Backlog Cleanup & Status Alignment

**Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h  
**Focus**: Remove stale blockers, close completed stories, and sync backlog documentation. No new feature work.

## Summary
- Marked foundational ECS/physics stories (M1-001, M1-003, M1-013, M1-014) as complete in MCP backlog with supporting notes.
- Cleared BUG-201-related blockers from active items (M2-001, M3-001, M3-008, AR-003, AR-050) and refreshed next steps.
- Updated docs/plans/backlog.md statuses and next immediate action to reflect current focus on M3-013 SaveManager parity and travel overlay integration.

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` (status updates)
- MCP backlog adjustments for M1-001, M1-003, M1-013, M1-014, M2-001, M3-001, M3-008, AR-003, AR-050

## Verification
- No tests run (backlog/documentation-only changes).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Hook DistrictTravelOverlay into traversal-denied events and ensure Playwright coverage (carryover).
2. Finalise WorldStateManager/SaveManager parity tests (carryover).
3. Re-run particle runtime stress tests once bespoke particle sheets arrive (carryover).
4. Monitor the FX metrics Playwright scenario to keep deterministic sampler coverage stable (carryover).
5. Schedule resumed work for M2-001/M3-001/M3-008 once save-state objectives settle (new).
6. Pull AR-003 sprite batch into the next bespoke window and validate runtime art once scheduled (new).

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Closed: M1-001, M1-003, M1-013, M1-014 (`status = done`, completed_work recorded in MCP).
- Updated next steps/notes for M2-001, M3-001, M3-008, AR-003, AR-050 to remove obsolete BUG-201 dependency and reflect new scheduling context.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` now shows completed statuses and revised “Next immediate action”.

## Notes
- No code or asset content changes this cycle; focus remained on backlog hygiene per request.
