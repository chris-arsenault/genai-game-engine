# Autonomous Development Session #85 – Tutorial Trigger Migration & Procedural Baselines
**Date**: November 2, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h15m  
**Status**: Delivered precinct/tunnel manifest variants, migrated tutorial onboarding triggers to the registry toolkit, and wired our performance baseline runner into CI.

---

## Highlights
- Added precinct war room and alley spur authored variants with multi-edge seam metadata, extending the manifest for high-traffic precinct interiors and side-route alleys. Regression coverage in `tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js` now locks the new seam tags.
- Migrated TutorialScene onboarding volumes (Detective Vision training pad, deduction board prompt, precinct exit) onto `TriggerMigrationToolkit`. Definitions carry `tutorialStage` metadata, documentation is updated, and `tests/game/scenes/TutorialScene.triggers.test.js` guards the migration.
- Introduced `scripts/telemetry/performanceBaseline.js` + npm alias `telemetry:performance:baseline`, executed a five-run aggregate locally, and inserted the baseline step into GitHub Actions ahead of telemetry export.

---

## Deliverables
- Procedural variants: `src/game/procedural/templates/authoredTemplates.js`, `tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`, `docs/guides/procedural-generation-integration.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Tutorial trigger migration: `src/game/scenes/TutorialScene.js`, `tests/game/scenes/TutorialScene.triggers.test.js`, `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- Telemetry baseline tooling: `scripts/telemetry/performanceBaseline.js`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `package.json`, `telemetry-artifacts/performance/test-ci-baseline.json`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/TutorialScene.triggers.test.js`
- `npm run telemetry:performance:baseline -- --runs 5 --out telemetry-artifacts/performance/test-ci-baseline.json`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Procedural manifest coverage** – Additional interiors (precinct war rooms variants outside Act 1, alley branches tied to future tile drops) remain outstanding; continue coordinating with art for upcoming tilemaps before authoring new seam layouts.
2. **Telemetry guardrail ops** – Need to collect the first CI artifact bundle, confirm five-run averages stay below thresholds, and document retention/alerting policies to close `PERF-119`.
3. **Quest trigger audit** – Registry migration now covers Act 1 tutorial + Memory Parlor; Act 2 hubs and follow-up beats still require conversion and regression coverage.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Pull the first CI run after the baseline step lands, archive the five-run JSON, and record retention/alert rules for `PERF-119`.
- Identify the next registry migration target (e.g., Act 2 hub transitions) and draft helper geometry/tests mirroring the tutorial approach.
- Continue expanding the authored template manifest once incoming precinct/side-alley tiles arrive; pre-stage seam tags for corridor painter integration.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- **PROC-221** updated with Session 85 precinct war room + alley spur variant work (Jest coverage + docs refresh).
- **QUEST-442** amended to capture TutorialScene trigger migration, new docs, and regression coverage.
- **PERF-119** now records the baseline runner integration, with next steps refocused on artifact review + alerting documentation.

## Metrics & Notes
- Performance baseline (five-run aggregate via `npm run telemetry:performance:baseline`):
  - Forensic analysis avg **0.0296 ms** (max 0.0872 ms) – threshold 4 ms.
  - Faction reputation modify avg **0.0031 ms** – threshold 2 ms.
  - Faction attitude lookup avg **0.0002 ms** – threshold 0.05 ms.
  - BSP generation avg **5.62 ms** (max 13.21 ms) – threshold 10 ms.
- Tutorial trigger definitions now embed `tutorialStage` metadata to drive onboarding UI copy and telemetry.
- Telemetry baseline artifacts stored under `telemetry-artifacts/performance/ci-baseline.json` (CI) and `test-ci-baseline.json` (local smoke); `.gitignore` already excludes the directory.
