# Autonomous Development Session #124 – Quest Availability Guard & Neon Glow Approvals

**Date**: November 16, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 55m  
**Focus**: Close the outstanding EntityManager review by adding proactive QuestManager notifications, harden SaveManager inspector exports with payload budgeting, and surface neon signage approval state for RenderOps/Narrative follow-up.

---

## Summary
- Added `quest:npc_availability` events and throttled warnings inside `QuestManager`, keeping NPC-dependent objectives informed without log spam while exposing availability state to UI/QA consumers.
- Instrumented SaveManager inspector exports with a 12 KB spatial telemetry budget, emitting `telemetry:export_budget_status` events + warnings whenever history payloads exceed the guard and expanding Jest coverage for the exporter + manager.
- Authored the neon glow approval summarizer (`scripts/art/summarizeNeonGlowApprovals.js`) and generated `reports/art/neon-glow-approval-status.(json|md)` to highlight remaining narrative approvals for the neon district tileset alongside all glow overlays.
- Updated backlog records (M1-002 → done, AR-050 new automation) and refreshed `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` / `docs/plans/backlog.md` with the new guardrails and reporting workflow.

---

## Deliverables
- **Engine / Narrative Integration**
  - `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js`: NPC availability state map + `_setNpcAvailability` helper, `quest:npc_availability` events, and throttled warning signatures.
  - `tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js`: Coverage for availability event emission, duplicate suppression, and restoration on interaction.
- **Telemetry / Save Manager**
  - `src/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.js`: Added `SPATIAL_HISTORY_BUDGET_BYTES` and budget status fields to sanitized spatial telemetry.
  - `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`: Emits `telemetry:export_budget_status` events and warns on budget overruns.
  - `tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`: Assertions for budget metadata and over-budget event/warning behaviour.
- **Art Pipeline Automation**
  - `scripts/art/summarizeNeonGlowApprovals.js`: CLI to collate neon signage/glow manifest entries with approval heuristics.
  - `reports/art/neon-glow-approval-status.(json|md)`: Generated summary showing 25 tracked assets and the lone outstanding narrative approval (image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district).
  - `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Documented the new summary workflow and session outcomes.
- **Tooling**
  - `package.json`: Added `npm run art:summarize-neon-glow` alias to invoke the new summarizer.

---

## Verification
- `npm test`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Review `reports/art/neon-glow-approval-status.md` with Narrative to capture sign-off for `image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district`, then update manifest licensing/status.
2. Share the neon glow summary with RenderOps alongside the latest packet to gather feedback on any remaining Act 2 lighting segments that need tweaks.
3. Surface the new `telemetry:export_budget_status` events inside CI/QA dashboards so payload budget regressions raise visible alerts.
4. Monitor downstream usage of `quest:npc_availability` and wire the events into debug overlays or quest UI as needed.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `M1-002` marked **done** with Session 124 availability notifications + tests recorded; next steps cleared.
- `AR-050` completed work now references the neon glow approval summarizer; next steps narrowed to delivering approvals using the new report.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` v1.2 and `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` updated with Session 124 notes and reporting instructions for neon glow approvals.

---

## Notes
- New neon glow summary lives at `reports/art/neon-glow-approval-status.(json|md)`; rerun `npm run art:summarize-neon-glow` after each manifest update.
- Spatial telemetry budget guard is set to 12 KB; adjust `SPATIAL_HISTORY_BUDGET_BYTES` if retention windows change.
