# Autonomous Development Session #63 – Debug HUD Telemetry Surfaces

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0h44m (Start ≈2025-10-29T10:05:00-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-29T10:49:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Debug overlay and SaveManager inspector now surface cascade + tutorial telemetry with automated coverage and refreshed docs.

---

## Executive Summary
- Extended the in-game debug overlay to render faction cascade summaries and tutorial snapshot timelines using the new WorldStateStore selectors.
- Added `SaveManager.getInspectorSummary()` so QA can pull cascade/tutorial telemetry from the console inspector, backed by new Jest coverage.
- Authored a Playwright smoke (`tests/e2e/debug-overlay-telemetry.spec.js`) that seeds store events, validates HUD output, and guards against console regressions while re-confirming the state-store benchmark guardrail.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Overlay & DOM updates**: `index.html`, `src/main.js` render cascade counts, sources, and tutorial snapshot metadata (latest + timeline) with relative time helpers and signature caching.
- **Inspector support**: `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js` exposes `getInspectorSummary()`; Jest suite (`tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`) now covers missing-store fallbacks and selector-driven output.
- **Automated coverage**: New Playwright spec `tests/e2e/debug-overlay-telemetry.spec.js` dispatches cascade/tutorial actions, asserts HUD text, and enforces clean console output; `playwright-results.xml` captures the run.
- **Documentation & backlog**: Refreshed `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`, and `docs/plans/backlog.md`; created MCP backlog item `DEBUG-248` (`110608e2-b467-4773-855f-6757360ba8fb`) marked complete with follow-up notes.
- **Benchmarks**: `node benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js` re-run—dispatch latency remains 0.0106 ms (PASS vs. 0.25 ms threshold).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- SaveManager`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/debug-overlay-telemetry.spec.js`
- `node benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Surface cascade + tutorial telemetry in the in-game HUD/debug overlay panels players see (beyond developer DOM) and refresh SaveManager UI summaries.
2. Consider exporting the cascade timeline/tutorial snapshots for external QA tooling or CI artifacts once HUD integration lands.
3. Continue monitoring benchmark output in CI; additional telemetry consumers could raise dispatch cost.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Wire cascade and tutorial summaries into primary HUD/overlay widgets and SaveManager inspector UIs.
- Evaluate broader observability (e.g., CSV/JSON exports, visual timelines) leveraging `getInspectorSummary()` output.
- Plan additional Playwright coverage to assert cascade metadata within user-facing overlays once integrated.

## Artifact Locations
- Overlay telemetry: `index.html`, `src/main.js`
- Inspector summary logic: `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`
- Tests: `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`, `tests/e2e/debug-overlay-telemetry.spec.js`
- Docs: `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- Backlog: MCP item `DEBUG-248` (`110608e2-b467-4773-855f-6757360ba8fb`)
- Benchmark output: `benchmark-results/` & `playwright-results.xml`
