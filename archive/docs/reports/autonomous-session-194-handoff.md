# Autonomous Development Session #194 – Tutorial Case Alignment

**Date**: 2025-11-03  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~65m  
**Focus**: Align tutorial case data and witness flow with the Act 1 M1.1 quest specification.

## Summary
- Brought `tutorialCase` data in sync with Act 1 M1.1 by adding the anonymous tip evidence, expanding the clue set, and refining tutorial guidance for each investigation beat.
- Added Mrs. Chen witness metadata and dialogue, refreshed Officer Martinez’s script to reference Marcus directly, and gated interviews behind relevant evidence cleanup.
- Extended Jest coverage to guard witness clue unlocks and ensured the tutorial scene registers both dialogue trees; backlog/docs now flag M2-013 as complete.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/data/cases/tutorialCase.js` — Revised objectives, evidence, clues, theory graph, and tutorial hints to reflect the quest narrative.
- `src/game/data/dialogues/MartinezWitnessDialogue.js` — Rewritten dialogue tree aligning with Marcus’s hollowing timeline and the investigative pattern reveal.
- `src/game/data/dialogues/MrsChenWitnessDialogue.js` — New neighbor dialogue exposing the anonymous tip routing and supporting clue unlock.
- `src/game/scenes/TutorialScene.js` — Dialogue registration now loads Martinez/Mrs. Chen trees when absent, protecting tutorial bootstrap.
- `tests/game/data/cases/tutorialCase.test.js` — Added guard ensuring witness `unlocksClues` map to defined case clues.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Marked M2-013 complete with supporting session notes.

## Verification
- `npm test -- tutorialCase`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. **AR-050** – Monitor RenderOps feedback for the 2025-10-31 Act 2 Crossroads packet and rerun the bespoke sweep automation on 2025-11-07 (`npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2`).
2. **AR-050 / M3-016** – Re-run telemetry outbox checks during the 2025-11-07 automation window, logging autosave/lighting acknowledgements immediately.
3. **UX-410** – Execute `node scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.js --label autosave-20251107` on 2025-11-07 and archive results.
4. Run the Playwright investigation suite (`npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/investigation-save-load.spec.js`) during the next CI window to confirm browser automation coverage stays green.
