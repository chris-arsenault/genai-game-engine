# Autonomous Development Session #68 – Telemetry Export CLI & Playwright Attachments

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h35m (Start ≈2025-10-30T10:05-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-30T11:40-07:00)  
**Status**: Phase 2 CLI + CI publisher implemented; Playwright telemetry attachments online with documentation/backlog aligned.

---

## Highlights
- Implemented `CiArtifactPublisher` with metadata manifest generation, optional upload command runner, and EventBus lifecycle events plus Jest coverage.
- Shipped `scripts/telemetry/exportInspectorTelemetry.js` (npm run `export-telemetry`) orchestrating SaveManager export, filesystem writer, and Ci publisher with an integration test validating dry-run outputs.
- Added `captureTelemetryArtifacts` Playwright helper and migrated the cascade mission spec to persist/attach inspector telemetry using the shared writer pipeline.
- Updated world-state observability docs and tutorial automation guide with CLI instructions, helper usage, and refreshed verification commands; backlog item `PO-002` now reflects Phase 2 progress.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.js`
- `scripts/telemetry/exportInspectorTelemetry.js`
- `tests/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.test.js`
- `tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/utils/telemetryArtifacts.js`
- `tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js` (helper adoption)
- Documentation:  
  - `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` (CLI + helper guidance)  
  - `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md` (telemetry capture section)  
  - `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session #68 progress note)
- `package.json` (`export-telemetry` npm script)

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.test.js tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js` ✅
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js` ✅

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **CI adoption of export CLI** – Wire provider-specific upload commands and monitor `CiArtifactPublisher` metrics during pipeline runs.  
2. **Playwright rollout** – Extend `captureTelemetryArtifacts` helper to tutorial/debug suites and confirm attachment expectations with QA.  
3. **Tutorial transcript recorder** – Begin recorder pipeline once CLI/helper usage stabilises; re-run telemetry + state-store benchmarks to guard dispatch budgets.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Integrate `npm run export-telemetry` (with upload command JSON) into CI and capture resulting manifests for review.
- Apply the telemetry helper to remaining Playwright specs, updating docs & reports with attachment naming conventions.
- Kick off the tutorial transcript recorder implementation per `docs/plans/tutorial-transcript-export-plan.md`.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated backlog item `PO-002` with new completed work entries (Ci publisher, CLI, Playwright helper) and refreshed next steps (CI integration, broader helper rollout, transcript recorder kickoff).
- Documentation now mirrors MCP state; no additional architecture decisions recorded.

---

## Metrics
- `runTelemetryExport` integration test (dry-run) produced 3 inspector artifacts and `ci-artifacts.json` metadata manifest without upload commands.
- Telemetry writer benchmark unchanged this session (Phase 1 baseline: mean 1.39 ms over 5 iterations).
