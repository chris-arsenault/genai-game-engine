# Autonomous Development Session #69 – CI Telemetry Wiring & Tutorial Transcript Kickoff

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h40m (Start ≈2025-10-31T09:55-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-31T11:35-07:00)  
**Status**: Telemetry export now embedded in CI, Playwright helper coverage expanded, and tutorial transcript infrastructure scaffolded with SaveManager integration.

---

## Highlights
- Added a dedicated "Export inspector telemetry artifacts" stage to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, piping `npm run export-telemetry` output into a persistent `telemetry-artifacts` upload and supporting configurable upload commands via `TELEMETRY_CI_COMMANDS*` env hooks.
- Extended `captureTelemetryArtifacts` adoption across tutorial and debug Playwright suites with resilient error attachments, ensuring QA receives matching JSON/CSV exports from cascade, tutorial, and debug scenarios.
- Delivered `TutorialTranscriptRecorder` + serializer helpers with Jest coverage and wired the recorder into `SaveManager.getInspectorSummary()` so transcript timelines surface in JSON artifacts ahead of CSV/Markdown export work.

---

## Deliverables
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` – exports telemetry post-Playwright, uploads artifacts, and seeds JSON context payloads.  
- `.github/ci/telemetry-commands.json` – placeholder command list for downstream provider hooks.  
- `scripts/telemetry/exportInspectorTelemetry.js` – env/file command resolution, cleanup logging, and integration-test coverage for new pathways.  
- `src/game/tutorial/TutorialTranscriptRecorder.js`, `src/game/tutorial/serializers/tutorialTranscriptSerializer.js` plus Jest suites.  
- `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`, `src/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.js` – transcript summary integration and metrics updates.  
- Playwright specs (`tutorial-overlay`, `debug-overlay-telemetry`, `debug-overlay-inventory`) updated to auto-capture telemetry artifacts.  
- Docs refreshed (`docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`).

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js`  
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/debug-overlay-telemetry.spec.js --reporter=list`  
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js --reporter=list --timeout=60000`  
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/tutorial/TutorialTranscriptRecorder.test.js tests/game/tutorial/tutorialTranscriptSerializer.test.js tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Transcript artifact formats** – Extend `createInspectorExportArtifacts()` to emit tutorial transcript CSV/Markdown and plumb format toggles through CLI + Playwright helper once ready.  
2. **Provider command wiring** – Update `.github/ci/telemetry-commands.json` (or env secrets) with real upload commands after validating GitHub CLI availability; monitor metadata manifests for regressions.  
3. **Helper transcript options** – Allow `captureTelemetryArtifacts` to request transcript formats and expand Playwright expectations once exporter support lands.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Implement transcript artifact generation (CSV/Markdown) and expose format flags through CLI/Playwright paths.  
- Configure provider-specific telemetry upload commands in CI and capture resulting `ci-artifacts.json` for review.  
- Add tutorial transcript Playwright assertions to validate recorder output end-to-end once exports are available.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated backlog item `PO-002` with CI integration, helper rollout, and transcript recorder scaffolding under completed work. Next steps now focus on transcript artifact formats, CI command wiring, and helper enhancements.

---

## Metrics
- Integration suite (`tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js`) validated env-based command resolution (dry-run + single command execution) with three artifacts and `ci-artifacts.json` manifests.  
- Tutorial Playwright pack now emits telemetry artifacts across seven tutorial cases in ~4.5s on local Chromium.  
- New transcript recorder + serializer Jest suites execute in <50 ms combined; SaveManager summary now reports `transcriptCount` (seeded runs: 0 entries until recorder attached at runtime).
