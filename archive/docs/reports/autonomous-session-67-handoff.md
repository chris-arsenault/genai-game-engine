# Autonomous Development Session #67 – Telemetry Export Phase 1 Implementation

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h15m (Start ≈2025-10-30T13:25-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-30T14:40-07:00)  
**Status**: Telemetry writer adapter + filesystem pipeline implemented; SaveManager export now async with metrics; benchmark + docs/backlog updated ahead of Phase 2 CLI work.

---

## Highlights
- Delivered `TelemetryArtifactWriterAdapter` with EventBus instrumentation, failure isolation, and Jest coverage validating fan-out + metrics aggregation.
- Added `FileSystemTelemetryWriter` and corresponding unit tests to persist artifacts with deterministic UTF-8 output and directory bootstrapping.
- Refactored `SaveManager.exportInspectorSummary()` to async, defaulting to the adapter when no writer provided, emitting telemetry events, and updating Playwright + Jest suites.
- Authored `benchmarks/telemetry-export-writer.js` and captured baseline timings (mean 1.39 ms over 5 iterations, all artifacts written).
- Refreshed documentation (`docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`) plus `docs/plans/backlog.md` progress and MCP backlog item `PO-002` to reflect Phase 1 completion.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/telemetry/TelemetryArtifactWriterAdapter.js`
- `src/game/telemetry/FileSystemTelemetryWriter.js`
- `tests/game/telemetry/TelemetryArtifactWriterAdapter.test.js`
- `tests/game/telemetry/FileSystemTelemetryWriter.test.js`
- `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js` (async export integration + telemetry events)
- `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js` (adapter + legacy writer coverage)
- `tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js` (await export pipeline)
- `benchmarks/telemetry-export-writer.js`
- Documentation updates in `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/TelemetryArtifactWriterAdapter.test.js tests/game/telemetry/FileSystemTelemetryWriter.test.js tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js` ✅
- `node benchmarks/telemetry-export-writer.js 5` (Mean 1.387 ms, Min 1.173 ms, Max 1.652 ms, 15/15 artifacts written, 0 failures) ✅

Console chatter from SaveManager suite arises from existing init/cleanup logs; no new warnings or errors observed.

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Phase 2 – CLI + CI Publisher**  
   - Implement `scripts/telemetry/exportInspectorTelemetry.js`, compose CLI args, and integrate `CiArtifactPublisher` for runner uploads + dry-run behavior.
2. **Phase 3 – Playwright Helper + Attachments**  
   - Build shared telemetry helper to attach artifacts via `testInfo`, update tutorial mission specs, and document helper usage.
3. **Tutorial Transcript Recorder (Plan A/B)**  
   - Implement recorder/serializer pipeline ensuring bounded buffers and export integration alongside telemetry adapter.
4. **CI/Benchmark Guardrails**  
   - Wire new benchmark + CLI into CI, track adapter metrics (artifactsWritten vs failures), and investigate if mean latency trends above 10 ms per artifact or dispatch variance exceeds +0.01 ms.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Scaffold telemetry export CLI + `CiArtifactPublisher` per plan (Phase 2), including dependency injection for command runners and dry-run mode.
- Introduce Playwright telemetry helper skeleton so CLI + helper share adapter wiring (can be stubbed while finishing CLI).
- Begin tutorial transcript recorder implementation once CLI scaffolding is stable or delegate via backlog split if capacity tight.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated backlog item `PO-002` with Phase 1 completion notes, remaining next steps, and benchmark metric. Status remains `in-progress` pending CLI + Playwright phases.
- Documentation mirrors backlog changes (`docs/plans/backlog.md` progress note) and telemetry guidance updates.
- No new architecture decisions required; existing plan documents remain authoritative for upcoming phases.

---

## Metrics
- `telemetry-export-writer` benchmark (5 iterations): **Mean 1.387 ms**, Min 1.173 ms, Max 1.652 ms, 0 failures (target <10 ms per artifact).  
- WorldStateStore dispatch benchmark unchanged from prior session (0.0100 ms mean).
