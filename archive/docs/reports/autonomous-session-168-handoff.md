# Autonomous Development Session #168 – Directional Locomotion & Ops Telemetry

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~90m  
**Focus**: Deliver directional locomotion for Kira, retune downtown adaptive music with the new stems, and harden RenderOps approval telemetry automation.

## Summary
- Generated a scripted directional placeholder sheet (`image-ar-003-kira-core-pack.png`), updated player animation logic for facing-aware idle/walk/run loops, and refreshed Jest coverage for movement + locomotion systems.
- Retuned `GameConfig.audio.act2CrossroadsAmbient` base/tension/combat balances (including a new combat state) and expanded AdaptiveMusicLayerController regression tests to guard the downtown mix sequencing.
- Fixed `monitorRenderOpsApprovals.js` import gaps, added aggregated job/queue/actionable metrics to the summary payload, and introduced Jest coverage exercising the CLI against staged telemetry.

## Deliverables
- Player locomotion: `assets/generated/images/ar-003/image-ar-003-kira-core-pack.png`, `src/game/entities/PlayerEntity.js`, `src/game/components/PlayerController.js`, `src/game/systems/PlayerAnimationSystem.js`, `src/game/systems/PlayerMovementSystem.js`, `tests/game/systems/PlayerAnimationSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/PlayerMovementSystem.navigation.test.js`.
- Audio tuning: `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`, `tests/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusicLayerController.test.js`.
- Ops automation: `scripts/art/monitorRenderOpsApprovals.js`, `tests/scripts/monitorRenderOpsApprovals.test.js`.
- Documentation & manifests: `assets/images/requests.json`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

## Verification
- `npm test`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Swap the scripted placeholder with bespoke idle/walk/run art and capture refreshed autosave overlays once the final sheet lands (AR-003).
2. Validate the retuned downtown mix against live in-game triggers after the ambient base stem is sourced, documenting scrambler boost behavior for QA (AR-008).
3. Keep running `node scripts/art/monitorRenderOpsApprovals.js --verbose` during automation sweeps to leverage the new summary metrics and trigger feedback imports as needed (AR-050).

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- **AR-003** records the directional placeholder integration, facing-aware animation logic, and refreshed locomotion tests with follow-ups scoped to bespoke swap + autosave captures.
- **AR-008** notes the retuned Crossroads adaptive mix (base/tension/combat gains + combat state) and updated regression coverage.
- **AR-050** documents the RenderOps monitor enhancements (aggregated metrics + Jest coverage) and revised usage guidance.
