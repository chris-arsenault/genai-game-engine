# Autonomous Development Session #98 - Act 2 Review Toolchain & Manifest Prep  
**Date**: November 7, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h00m  
**Status**: Act 2 Crossroads manifest scaffolded for art drop-in, branch dialogue exports unlocked narrative review, and telemetry harness now streams analytics-ready datasets.

---

## Highlights
- Added a repository-scoped Act 2 Crossroads art manifest (`assets/manifests/act2-crossroads-art.json`) and wired `GameConfig.sceneArt.act2Crossroads` to consume manifest + overrides with new regression coverage.
- Delivered Act 2 branch dialogue exporter module + CLI so narrative/VO teams can review quest metadata and ordered dialogue lines in one artifact.
- Extended `QuestTelemetryValidationHarness` with analytics dataset exports and produced a CLI that converts captured telemetry logs into warehouse-ready JSON.

---

## Deliverables
- `assets/manifests/act2-crossroads-art.json`, `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`, `src/game/data/sceneArt/Act2CrossroadsArtConfig.js`, `tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.artOverrides.test.js`
- `src/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.js`, `scripts/narrative/exportAct2BranchDialogues.js`, `tests/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.test.js`
- `src/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.js`, `scripts/telemetry/exportQuestTelemetryDashboard.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.analytics.test.js`
- Docs: `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.artOverrides.test.js tests/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.test.js tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.analytics.test.js`
- `npm test` *(full suite – passes; standing BSPGenerator perf variance remains unchanged)*

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Bespoke art ingestion** – Await final art bundle; replace placeholder manifest entries, ship textures, and rerun Crossroads hub layout/navigation suites.
2. **Narrative copy polish** – Provide exported dialogue summaries to narrative/VO reviewers; fold in any revised lines and refresh dialogue tests/documents.
3. **Analytics schema validation** – Run the new telemetry dashboard exporter against production event logs once warehouse refresh completes to confirm schema parity.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Swap in final Act 2 Crossroads art manifest and verify hub rendering + collision coverage.
- Share dialogue export artifacts with narrative stakeholders and track requested script adjustments.
- Feed live telemetry captures through `npm run telemetry:dashboard` to ensure analytics dashboards ingest without schema conflicts.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated `QUEST-610` with manifest scaffold, dialogue exporter, and telemetry analytics tooling deliverables plus refreshed next steps focusing on art delivery, copy review, and analytics hookup.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the MCP priorities; Next Session focus now references the new manifest + exporter workflows.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Manifest pipeline keeps authored geometry intact while allowing designers to hot-drop bespoke assets via JSON.
- Dialogue exporter produces six branch dialogue summaries with quest/objective/telemetry metadata for immediate copy vetting.
- Telemetry analytics dataset includes raw rows (optional) and dashboard aggregate, aligning with warehouse schema requirements and reducing manual prep time.
