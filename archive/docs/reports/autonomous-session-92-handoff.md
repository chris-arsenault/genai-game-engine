# Autonomous Development Session #92 - Corporate Thread Interior Bring-Up  
**Date**: November 7, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h10m  
**Status**: The Act 2 corporate branch now loads a fully-authored interior with quest scaffolding, and the thread loader resolves scenes through a declarative registry.

---

## Highlights
- Authored `loadAct2CorporateInfiltrationScene` with NeuroSync lobby/security/server access geometry, registry-backed triggers, and navigation mesh metadata for the first Act 2 thread interior.
- Refactored `Game.loadAct2ThreadScene` to use a loader map, handle spawn/ambient state, emit `scene:loaded` payloads, and provide a safe fallback when interiors remain unimplemented.
- Registered the NeuroSync branch quest (`main-act2-neurosync-infiltration`), added scene loader configuration to `GameConfig`, and refreshed docs/backlog to reflect the new branch coverage.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/scenes/Act2CorporateInfiltrationScene.js`  
- `src/game/data/quests/act2NeuroSyncQuest.js`  
- `src/game/Game.js` (Act 2 thread loader registry + quest registration)  
- `src/game/config/GameConfig.js` (thread scene ids)  
- `tests/game/scenes/Act2CorporateInfiltrationScene.test.js`  
- `tests/game/Game.act2ThreadScene.test.js`  
- `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md` (corporate trigger map + notes)  
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session 92 progress)  
- `docs/reports/autonomous-session-92-handoff.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2CorporateInfiltrationScene.test.js tests/game/Game.act2ThreadScene.test.js`
- `npm test`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Remaining branch interiors** — Resistance and Personal Investigation scenes still need authored interiors, loader entries, and coverage before branching is fully playable (`QUEST-610`).  
2. **Crossroads art/nav package** — Final art/navigation mesh drop is still pending; once delivered we must validate collision, overlays, and the new loader surfaces against production assets.  
3. **Quest progression validation** — The NeuroSync quest scaffold is minimal; downstream objectives, dialogue, and ability unlock hooks need integration pass to ensure narrative beats align with the new scene.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Build the Resistance branch interior with registry triggers and add it to the loader map, mirroring the corporate thread patterns.  
- Integrate the final Crossroads art/navigation bundle and rerun navigation constraint + loader tests to confirm mesh fidelity.  
- Flesh out NeuroSync quest objectives/dialogue beats so the new scene progresses beyond entry/escape scaffolding.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated MCP backlog item `QUEST-610` with Session 92 progress, appended remaining next steps, and linked new verification commands.  
- Recorded architecture decision “Introduce loader registry for Act 2 thread scenes.”  
- Refreshed `docs/plans/backlog.md` to mirror the latest MCP state and documented the corporate trigger map in `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- The corporate interior scene exposes navigation mesh nodes (`lobby_spawn`, `security_checkpoint`, `server_hall_entry`) and walkable surfaces for reuse by `NavigationMeshService`.  
- `Game.loadAct2ThreadScene` now emits `scene:transition:act2_thread:error` on loader failures, keeping analytics aware of missing interiors while preserving metadata for UI/telemetry consumers.  
- Jest suite passes (2124 tests) with new targeted coverage for the loader registry and NeuroSync trigger migration.
