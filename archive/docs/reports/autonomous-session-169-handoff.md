# Autonomous Development Session #169 – Movement Audio QA & Locomotion References

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~90m  
**Focus**: Harden directional movement feedback automation (CORE-302) and capture AR-003 locomotion reference frames for placeholder review.

## Summary
- Locked GameConfig-driven movement/prompt cue volumes into automated coverage via `tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js` and extended the Playwright movement overlay suite to assert the same telemetry.
- Broadened `PlayerAnimationSystem` coverage to guard directional idle/walk/run loop selection so future sprite swaps retain locomotion behaviour guarantees.
- Authored `scripts/art/capturePlayerLocomotionFrames.js`, generated idle/walk/run reference crops plus facing contact sheets (`reports/art/player-locomotion-reference/`), and mirrored the automation in docs/manifests for AR-003.

## Deliverables
- Movement feedback automation: `tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js`, `tests/e2e/feedback-overlays.spec.js`.
- Directional locomotion coverage: `tests/game/systems/PlayerAnimationSystem.test.js`.
- Locomotion capture tooling & outputs: `scripts/art/capturePlayerLocomotionFrames.js`, `reports/art/player-locomotion-reference/*`, new npm alias `art:capture-locomotion` in `package.json`.
- Documentation/manifests: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `assets/images/requests.json`.

## Verification
- `npm test`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/feedback-overlays.spec.js`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. **AR-003** – Replace placeholder core sheet with bespoke art when delivered, then run traversal QA to reconfirm dash/slide alignment.
2. **CORE-302** – Document camera centering parameters in `CameraConfig.js` and surface the notes for CORE-303 handoff.
3. **AR-050** – Continue running RenderOps monitoring (`scripts/art/monitorRenderOpsApprovals.js --verbose`) during art sweeps to keep approval telemetry fresh.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated CORE-302 backlog record with automated cue validation progress; camera documentation remains flagged.
- AR-003 backlog now tracks the locomotion capture script and reference exports with follow-ups trimmed to bespoke swap + traversal QA.
- Refreshed visual asset inventory (Session 169) and manifests to reference the new locomotion capture outputs and automation entry point.
