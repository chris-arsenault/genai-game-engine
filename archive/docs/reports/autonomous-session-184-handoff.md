# Autonomous Development Session #184 – Kira Bespoke Integration

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Ingest bespoke Kira locomotion art and refresh save/load QA artifacts.

## Summary
- Updated `scripts/art/normalize_kira_evasion_pack.py` to prefer the bespoke core sheet, regenerated the normalized atlas/manifest, and refreshed `kiraAnimationConfig.js` via automation so gameplay pulls the new idle/walk/run frames.
- Re-captured locomotion reference crops/contact sheets (`reports/art/player-locomotion-reference/*`) to align autosave overlays and traversal QA with the bespoke-normalized atlas.
- Repackaged save/load QA assets with the refreshed art footprint, producing a new telemetry packet + archive for M3-016 baselines.

## Backlog Adjustments
- **AR-003** shifted to `ready-for-review` after normalization, config refresh, and locomotion capture automation; next monitoring hook is the traversal Playwright sweep.
- **M3-016** recorded the bespoke ingestion plus QA packet refresh; new follow-up is staging the packet distribution once analytics acknowledges the baseline.
- WIP count remains 3 (AR-003, AR-050, M3-016); no additional pulls required.

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. AR-003 – Observe the next automated traversal/overlay run to confirm dash/slide cohesion with the bespoke atlas.
2. M3-016 – Dispatch the fresh save/load QA packet via `npm run telemetry:distribute-save-load` after analytics ack.
3. AR-050 – Resume bespoke tracking automation once save/load parity dependencies unblock (unchanged from Session 183).
4. AR-008 / QUEST-610 / UX-410 – Still blocked awaiting audio stem, RenderOps validation, and automated UX guidance respectively.

## Verification
```bash
python scripts/art/normalize_kira_evasion_pack.py
node scripts/art/updateKiraAnimationConfig.js
npm run art:capture-locomotion
npm run telemetry:package-save-load
npm test
```
