# Autonomous Development Session #114 – Crossroads Lighting Calibration

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h15m  
**Status**: Crossroads lighting overlays recalibrated; awaiting RenderOps approval and AR-001–AR-005 generation review.

---

## Summary
- Raised the selection conduit overlay alpha coverage and warmed its palette (`assets/images/overlay-derivatives-act2-crossroads.json`, `src/game/data/sceneArt/Act2CrossroadsArtConfig.js`) so projected luminance now lands at 0.485 (target 0.46) without breaching hotspot thresholds.
- Retuned the checkpoint glow and guard column overlays (alpha floors, tint, config weights) to hit their preset luminance targets while avoiding hotspots, regenerating `assets/overlays/act2-crossroads/*.png` accordingly.
- Refreshed the lighting preview (`reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json`) showing 9 ok segments and 2 skipped, updated docs/backlog, and logged the progress in AR-050 for RenderOps follow-up.

---

## Deliverables
- Overlay derivatives: updated parameters in `assets/images/overlay-derivatives-act2-crossroads.json` and regenerated conduit/glow/column PNGs under `assets/overlays/act2-crossroads/`.
- Art configuration: colour/alpha/metadata adjustments in `src/game/data/sceneArt/Act2CrossroadsArtConfig.js`.
- Reporting: refreshed `reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json` (statusCounts: {"ok": 9, "skipped": 2}).
- Documentation: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md` (AR-050), MCP backlog item AR-050 updated with Session 114 work.

## Verification
- `npm test -- Act2CrossroadsLightingPreviewer`
- `node scripts/art/previewCrossroadsLighting.js --out=reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **RenderOps lighting validation** – Share the refreshed preview report and secure sign-off or additional tweaks after in-engine review.
2. **AR-001–AR-005 asset approvals** – Run the queued generation batch, vet outputs, and replace provisional licensing metadata in `assets/images/requests.json`.
3. **Telemetry parity follow-up** – Monitor `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/parity-schedule.json` for the 2025-11-13 check and trigger cadence actions if analytics lags.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` – Added Session 114 calibration entry to completed work and refreshed next steps (RenderOps approval + AR-001–AR-005 processing).
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Logged Session 114 recalibration details and updated next actions to focus on RenderOps review and queued asset evaluation.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – High-priority table now reflects the luminance fixes and hand-off requirements for AR-050.

---

## Notes
- New alpha floors push average normalized coverage to 0.67–0.78 across conduit/glow/columns; keep an eye on performance when layering these brighter assets in-engine.
- Colour palette shifts (amber columns, cyan safehouse beams) should be reviewed with narrative lighting direction before freezing for shipping builds.
- Re-run the lighting preview after any RenderOps tweak to ensure summary counts remain clean for milestone reports.
