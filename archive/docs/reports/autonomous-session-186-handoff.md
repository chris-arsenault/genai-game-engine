# Autonomous Development Session #186 – AR-002 Evidence Sprite Sourcing

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Generate the AR-002 evidence sprite suite via automation, sync manifests/docs, and integrate the art into runtime defaults.

## Summary
- Generated holographic marker, fingerprint, dossier, neural extractor, and forensic vial sprites with `mcp__generate-image__generate_image`, captured 32×32 derivatives, and staged them under `assets/generated/images/ar-002/`.
- Promoted the five AR-002 manifest entries to `ai-generated`, refreshed `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, and re-ran the placeholder audit so reports reflect the new sourcing.
- Updated `EvidenceEntity` to auto-select the new sprites (with type-aware fallbacks) and swapped Act 1 crime scene markers to the holographic art, keeping palette QA coverage green with an updated Jest assertion.

## Backlog Adjustments
- **AR-002** (Evidence sprites) moved to `ready-for-review`; completed work and notes capture asset paths, runtime wiring, and validation.
- WIP count remains 4 (AR-002 `ready-for-review`, AR-003 `ready-for-review`, AR-050 `in-progress`, M3-016 `in-progress`); other items unchanged this session.

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. AR-002 – Narrative/art review the new sprites and confirm tutorial copy alignment.
2. AR-003 – Await narrative/art sign-off on bespoke Kira locomotion set (no new automation required).
3. M3-016 – Hold `npm run telemetry:distribute-save-load` until analytics acknowledges the refreshed baseline.
4. AR-050 – Resume bespoke tracking automation once save/load parity dependencies unblock.
5. AR-008 / QUEST-610 / UX-410 – Still blocked on audio stem delivery, RenderOps validation, and automated UX guidance respectively.

## Verification
```bash
npm run art:audit-placeholders
npm test  # Jest suites: 203/203 passing (~13.2s)
```
