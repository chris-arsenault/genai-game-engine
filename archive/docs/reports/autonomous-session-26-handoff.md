# Autonomous Development Session #26 – SaveManager Storage Parity

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.22 hours (2025-10-28T12:28:00-07:00 – 2025-10-28T12:41:30-07:00)  
**Status**: QA-202 closed; storage regression tests restored ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Added regression coverage for SaveManager’s `localStorage` dependency, ensuring save/load failures emit descriptive errors when storage is unavailable (QA-202).
- Updated the testing dashboard to reflect SaveManager coverage and logged backlog progress so QA ownership stays visible.
- Validated the SaveManager Jest suite plus tutorial Playwright smoke to confirm parity work did not introduce regressions.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **SaveManager Tests**: `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js` now asserts graceful handling of missing storage for both save and load paths, including `game:load_failed` emissions.
- **Documentation Sync**: `docs/testing/TestStatus.md` marks SaveManager unit tests as complete; `docs/plans/backlog.md` records Session #26 progress for QA-202.
- **Regression Confidence**: Targeted Jest run and `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` Playwright smoke both pass after the updates.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js` ✅
- `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` ✅

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Transcript retention tuning (TOOL-045)** – Benchmark overlay performance with long transcripts and enforce retention limits.
2. **LevelSpawnSystem perf spike (PERF-118)** – Collect spawn-loop telemetry to decide between optimization or threshold adjustments; pair with PERF-119 monitoring.
3. **CI Playwright integration (CI-014)** – Wire dialogue/quest/tutorial smokes into pipelines with junit + artifact retention.
4. **Procedural guardrail monitoring (PERF-119)** – Capture post-rebaseline data for TileMap/SeededRandom to confirm guardrails.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Profile LevelSpawnSystem spawn loops (PERF-118) and log telemetry into perf dashboards alongside PERF-119 metrics.
2. Design transcript retention benchmarks (TOOL-045) and apply limits based on performance findings.
3. Begin CI Playwright onboarding (CI-014), adding junit reporter + artifact uploads for the existing smoke triad.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 3 (`tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`, `docs/testing/TestStatus.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`)
- **Tests Added**: 2 SaveManager regression cases
- **Manual QA**: Observed Playwright tutorial automation to confirm overlay behavior post-changes

---

## Notes
- Restoring storage-unavailable coverage required temporarily removing the global `localStorage` mock during tests; mocks are restored after each regression case to avoid side-effects.
