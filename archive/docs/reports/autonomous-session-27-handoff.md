# Autonomous Development Session #27 – Core Scene Bring-Up

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.28 hours (2025-10-28T12:45:00-07:00 – 2025-10-28T13:01:45-07:00)  
**Status**: Scene rendering + camera centering restored; backlog refocused on core gameplay ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Brought the layered renderer back online for gameplay by registering `ground`/`environment` layers, redrawing dynamic layers each frame, and rendering a stylized background grid so the Act 1 scene is immediately visible.
- Centered and evented the camera follow system, ensuring the player is in view on load and camera movement notifies other systems (`camera:moved`) for tile redraws.
- Shifted the backlog away from performance/testing work toward core gameplay tasks (`CORE-301/302/303`) in line with the new priority directive.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Layered Rendering Fixes**: `src/engine/renderer/LayeredRenderer.js` now includes `ground` and `environment` layers, while `RenderSystem` marks dynamic layers dirty each frame and renders a neon background grid so movement is visible.
- **Camera Centering**: `CameraFollowSystem` centers on the player (subtracting half viewport) and emits `camera:moved`, keeping world layers aligned as the player moves.
- **Backlog Pivot**: `docs/plans/backlog.md` downgrades PERF/CI items to P3 and introduces CORE-30x tasks targeting scene bring-up, movement feedback, and the investigative loop skeleton.

---

## Verification
- Automated tests not run (rendering/camera changes lack coverage); manual verification will require an in-browser smoke after deployment.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **CORE-301** – Finish Act 1 visual bring-up (props, NPC silhouettes, crime scene decal).
2. **CORE-302** – Add immediate player feedback (movement cues, interaction prompts, audio stubs).
3. **CORE-303** – Build the investigative loop skeleton (evidence unlocks, witness dialogue, quest updates).
4. **Deprioritized backlog** – PERF/CI/TOOL items remain documented but paused until the interactive slice lands.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Implement CORE-301 visual polish so the scene feels grounded the moment the build loads.
2. Tackle CORE-302 to guarantee WASD/E interactions produce visible/audio feedback.
3. Begin wiring CORE-303 (evidence progression + witness dialogue) to demonstrate the narrative/system fusion.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 4 (`src/engine/renderer/LayeredRenderer.js`, `src/engine/renderer/RenderSystem.js`, `src/game/systems/CameraFollowSystem.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`)
- **Tests Added**: None (rendering/system behavior only)
- **Manual QA**: Not run; requires browser smoke to confirm visuals/camera behavior.

---

## Notes
- `RenderSystem` now produces a lightweight neon grid background; tweak colors later once art direction is ready.
- Camera movement emits `camera:moved` to keep parity with layer invalidation; additional systems can now listen for scroll-dependent updates.
