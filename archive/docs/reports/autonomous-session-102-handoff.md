# Autonomous Development Session #102 - Readiness Execution & Follow-Up Targets
**Date**: November 10, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h25m  
**Status**: CLI readiness/diff/parity guardrails executed; lighting gaps isolated for RenderOps follow-up and analytics sample prepped for ingestion.

---

## Highlights
- Act2Crossroads art validator flagged five lighting metadata gaps while confirming collision coverage is complete, giving RenderOps a targeted cleanup list.
- Act 2 branch dialogue exporter regenerated the Markdown + JSON bundle with zero diffs against the prior baseline, confirming no narrative edits need review.
- Quest telemetry parity check aggregated the 2025-11-12 Act 2 Crossroads sample (4 events) and reported 100% dataset/event/payload coverage for analytics sign-off.

---

## Deliverables
- Readiness outputs: `npm run art:validate-crossroads -- --manifest=assets/manifests/act2-crossroads-art.json`
- Narrative review bundle: `telemetry-artifacts/act2-branch-dialogues-summary.json`, `.md`, and `-changes.json`
- Telemetry sample + parity summary: `telemetry-artifacts/samples/quest-telemetry-act2-crossroads-2025-11-12.jsonl`
- Docs: `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm run art:validate-crossroads -- --manifest=assets/manifests/act2-crossroads-art.json`
- `npm run narrative:export-act2-dialogues -- --baseline=telemetry-artifacts/act2-branch-dialogues-summary-prev.json --changes-out=telemetry-artifacts/act2-branch-dialogues-changes.json --markdown --markdown-out=telemetry-artifacts/act2-branch-dialogues-summary.md`
- `npm run telemetry:check-parity -- --samples=telemetry-artifacts/samples/quest-telemetry-act2-crossroads-2025-11-12.jsonl`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Lighting metadata cleanup** – RenderOps must author lighting presets for `crossroads_briefing_pad` and the four light column segments called out by the readiness report before the walkthrough.
2. **Narrative reviewer coordination** – Distribute the zero-diff Markdown + changes bundle for confirmation and log approvals so we catch any late edits before localization.
3. **Analytics ingestion schedule** – Share the 2025-11-12 telemetry parity summary with analytics, then capture the next live log batch to ensure the checker continues to report full coverage.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Confirm RenderOps has applied lighting presets to the five flagged segments and re-run the validator to close the readiness loop.
- Deliver the narrative bundle to VO/editing stakeholders, capture sign-off notes, and archive the change report in the review folder.
- Coordinate with analytics on ingesting the current sample and plan the next parity run once fresh quest telemetry arrives.

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated `QUEST-610` with Session 102 completed work, refined next steps, and refreshed notes; mirrored the status in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Lighting readiness: 7/12 segments configured; collision readiness: 4/4 segments configured.
- Missing lighting presets: `crossroads_briefing_pad`, `crossroads_column_safehouse_left`, `crossroads_column_safehouse_right`, `crossroads_column_checkpoint_north`, `crossroads_column_checkpoint_south`.
- Telemetry parity coverage: dataset/event/payload buckets each reported 100% coverage on the 4-event Act 2 Crossroads sample.
