# Autonomous Development Session #42 – Memory Parlor Scene Stub & E2E Coverage

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0h40m (Start 2025-10-28T17:55:00-07:00 – End 2025-10-28T18:35:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Memory Parlor scene prototype landed with automated scrambler validation.

---

## Executive Summary
- Authored a dedicated `MemoryParlorScene` with scrambler-reactive firewall barrier, guard NPC dressing, and camera-ready spawn handling that reuses the existing player entity.
- Extended `Game` scene management to track the active scene, support quest-driven transitions via `loadMemoryParlorScene()`, and tolerate player entity ID `0`.
- Enabled multi-pass trigger volumes by updating `InteractionZone` and `InvestigationSystem`, allowing the firewall zone to re-arm between scrambler attempts.
- Added Playwright coverage that walks the infiltration quest beat, validates blocked messaging, scrambler activation, and confirms disguise modifiers change during the bypass window.
- Refreshed changelog, narrative quest notes, and backlog with the new scene stub plus follow-up work (SCN-410) for full level dressing and return routing.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Scene authoring**: New `src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js` wires entrance, firewall, and interior triggers, toggles barrier colliders on scrambler events, and seeds stealth props/NPCs.
- **Scene lifecycle**: `src/game/Game.js` now tracks `activeScene`, exposes `loadMemoryParlorScene()`, listens for `objective:completed` to auto-load the infiltration scene, and exposes spawn metadata to the camera.
- **Trigger resiliency**: `src/game/components/InteractionZone.js` and `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js` reset non-one-shot triggers after exit, enabling repeated firewall checks.
- **Act 1 cleanup**: `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js` now returns cleanup handlers so the quest unlock listener is removed during scene transitions.
- **Automated validation**: `tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js` asserts blocked messaging without scrambler access, confirms scrambler activation consumes charges and lowers disguise detection odds, and ensures the quest objective completes only during an active window.
- **Documentation & planning**: Updated `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, noted the new runtime behaviour in `docs/narrative/quests/act-1-quests.md`, and logged backlog item **SCN-410** for full Memory Parlor level polish.

## Verification
- `npm test` *(timeout after 13s)* – Jest still pulls in canvas-heavy integration suites that fail under jsdom (`ctx.createLinearGradient` undefined) and Playwright's Node-based test runner requiring `TransformStream`. No new regressions identified; failures match existing infrastructure gaps.
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js tests/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.test.js tests/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.scrambler.test.js` *(pass)* – Scrambler gating, quest blocking, and disguise modifiers remain green after scene integration.
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js` *(pass)* – End-to-end infiltration flow now green without forcing a manual scene load.

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **SCN-410 – Scene polish**: The new scene is a functional stub; geometry, stealth cover, quest-driven return to Act 1, and additional interactables remain outstanding.
2. **Runtime QA**: Need a manual/Playwright smoke that traverses the full infiltration objective including exit and follow-up dialogue once geometry is finalized.
3. **Performance follow-up**: Profiling harness still not exercised with the new scene; schedule a pass once the environment enables `npm run profile`.
4. **jsdom canvas gaps**: Integration suites continue to fail on missing canvas APIs; consider mocking gradients or gating those tests until a headless canvas shim is available.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Flesh out Memory Parlor interior (SCN-410): quest transition wiring back to Act 1, stealth props, evidence pickups, and exit triggers.
2. Author quest/scene regression tests that walk the full infiltration beat including escape and dialogue follow-ups.
3. Run broader Jest + profiling harness once scene polish lands, documenting any engine hotspots introduced by the new layout.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 9 existing files updated, 2 new files added.
- **Automated Coverage**: 1 new Playwright scenario; existing scrambler/disguise/quest Jest suites rerun successfully.
- **Verification Commands**:
  - `npm test`
  - `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js tests/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.test.js tests/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.scrambler.test.js`
  - `npx playwright test tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js`

---

## Notes
- `loadMemoryParlorScene()` now loads automatically when `obj_locate_parlor` completes; Playwright still sets up knowledge/inventory events manually to emulate vendor progression.
- InteractionZone resets proved necessary for firewall re-entry; keep an eye on other trigger usages that may benefit from the same behaviour.
- Backlog item **SCN-410** captures the remaining deliverables for making the scene demo-ready.
