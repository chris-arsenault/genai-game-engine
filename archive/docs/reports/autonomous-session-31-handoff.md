# Autonomous Development Session #31 – UI Overlay Edge Fix

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.6 hours (2025-10-28T13:30:00-07:00 – 2025-10-28T14:05:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Overlay toggles stable; dialogue/UI QA unblocked ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Patched the input edge-detection regression so disguise, reputation, and quest overlays (plus dialogue prompts) stay visible after a single key press.
- Updated the game loop to guard UI toggles with the new edge-trigger helper and confirmed manual QA can reopen overlays reliably.
- Added focused Jest coverage for the `InputState` edge tracker and overlay toggle behaviour to prevent future regressions.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Input System**: `InputState` now maintains a per-action `justPressed` map; `wasJustPressed` exposes edge-triggered checks while resetting on consumption (`src/game/config/Controls.js`).
- **Game Loop**: `Game.update` uses the new helper for pause/faction/disguise/quest toggles, ensuring overlays aren't immediately closed on the same frame (`src/game/Game.js`).
- **Testing**: Added `tests/game/config/Controls.test.js` and expanded `tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js` to lock in the regression fix.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/config/Controls.test.js tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`
- Manual sanity check: pressing `G`, `R`, and `Q` now opens overlays and they stay open until the next key press; dialogue prompt appears when interacting with NPC triggers.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Edge-trigger Adoption** – Inventory, deduction board, and future UI toggles must adopt `wasJustPressed` once their hooks are wired; tracked in backlog follow-up under BUG-312.
2. **Manual QA Sweep** – Run the broader UI/manual smoke (CORE-302 palette review, overlay styling) to confirm no visual regressions after the toggle fix.
3. **EventBus Deprecations** – Console still surfaces `.subscribe` deprecation warnings during tests; migrate to `.on` to quiet logs and prepare for API removal.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Execute the pending overlay styling + manual capture for CORE-302 now that toggles behave.
2. Audit remaining input-driven panels (inventory, deduction board) and refactor them to use `wasJustPressed`.
3. Continue audio asset pass or begin CORE-303 once UI polish wraps.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 6 (`src/game/config/Controls.js`, `src/game/Game.js`, `tests/game/config/Controls.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`)
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 2 Jest suites
- **Automated Tests Run**: Targeted Jest run (`tests/game/config/Controls.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`)
- **Manual QA**: Basic overlay toggle sanity check

---

## Notes
- `InputState.wasJustPressed` consumes the edge flag on read; systems that need multi-consumer behaviour should add dedicated helpers instead of reusing `isPressed`.
- Consider adding a small Playwright smoke that verifies overlay toggles via keyboard once manual polish is complete.
