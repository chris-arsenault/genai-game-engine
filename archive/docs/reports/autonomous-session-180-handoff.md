# Autonomous Development Session #180 – Manifest-Driven Player Animation Config

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Automate the Kira locomotion pipeline so bespoke sprite swaps only require rerunning the normalized manifest tooling.

## Summary
- Authored `scripts/art/updateKiraAnimationConfig.js` to parse the normalized dash/slide manifest and emit `src/game/data/animations/kiraAnimationConfig.js`, centralising frame metadata and durations.
- Refactored `PlayerEntity` to consume `buildKiraAnimationDefinitions()` so runtime animations stay synced with generated configs without manual frame arrays.
- Updated AR-003 notes in `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, mirrored M3-016 progress in `docs/plans/backlog.md`, and logged the automation pattern into MCP for reuse.

## Deliverables
- Manifest-driven animation automation: `scripts/art/updateKiraAnimationConfig.js`, generated `src/game/data/animations/kiraAnimationConfig.js`.
- Player runtime refactor: `src/game/entities/PlayerEntity.js` now binds to the generated config for dash/slide loops.
- Documentation refreshes covering AR-003 art pipeline expectations and M3-016 backlog status.

## Verification
```bash
npm test
```

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. When the bespoke idle/walk/run sheet lands, run `node scripts/art/updateKiraAnimationConfig.js` to refresh the config, swap in the new atlas, and rerun traversal QA to confirm dash/slide transitions remain aligned. (*M3-016 next step*)
2. Repackage Save/Load autosave assets after the bespoke swap so validator baselines and overlay captures reflect the final art. (*M3-016 next step*)
3. Continue monitoring faction reputation cascades during narrative playtests to ensure the adjusted baselines hold under story stressors. (Carryover from Session 178)
