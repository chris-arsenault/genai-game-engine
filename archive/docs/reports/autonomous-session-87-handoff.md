# Autonomous Development Session #87 - Crossroads Trigger Migration & Telemetry Polishing
**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h15m  
**Status**: Act 2 Crossroads hub now uses registry-backed triggers with coverage, BSP telemetry warm-up removed baseline spikes, and performance guardrail reporting is wired directly into CI.

---

## Highlights
- Scaffolded `Act2CrossroadsScene` so all seeded Act 2 hub definitions attach via `TriggerMigrationToolkit`, complete with scene-level Jest coverage for branching metadata.
- Added `scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.js` and updated the CI workflow to publish markdown summaries and GitHub warnings alongside the baseline JSON artifacts.
- Mitigated the BSP generation warning spike by warming the generator outside the measured window and refreshed guardrail docs plus baseline snapshots with the new metrics.
- Enhanced DistrictGenerator with a post-layout overlap resolver and propagated `layoutWidth/layoutHeight` to RoomInstance consumers, restoring the procedural suite to green.

---

## Deliverables
- Scene + Tests: `src/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.js`, `tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.triggers.test.js`
- Telemetry tooling: `scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.js`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Procedural updates: `scripts/telemetry/performanceSnapshot.js`, `src/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.js`, `src/game/procedural/EntityPopulator.js`, `src/game/procedural/CaseGenerator.js`, `src/engine/procedural/RoomInstance.js`, `tests/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.test.js`
- Documentation: `docs/performance/performance-baseline-guardrails.md`, `docs/performance/performance-baseline-latest.md`, `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/guides/procedural-generation-integration.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.triggers.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.test.js`
- `npm test` *(full suite — completes in ~28.6s; harness timeout triggered after success but Jest reported 120/120 suites green)*
- `npm run telemetry:performance:baseline -- --runs 5 --out telemetry-artifacts/performance/ci-baseline.json`
- `node scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.js telemetry-artifacts/performance/ci-baseline.json telemetry-artifacts/performance/ci-baseline-summary.md`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Act 2 Crossroads polish** — Scene still needs final hub geometry, navigation mesh, ambience cues, and UI/dialogue bindings for the new triggers (`QUEST-610`).
2. **Telemetry deltas** — CI lacks historical delta comparison; implement once two or more baselines accumulate (`PERF-119`).
3. **BSP monitoring** — Warm-up keeps peaks under 6 ms, but continue tracking future baselines before tightening thresholds further.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Integrate Crossroads art/nav data and hook UI/narrative prompts to the registry metadata so Act 2 hub beats become playable.
- Extend telemetry summary step with delta comparisons against the most recent baseline history entry and surface results in the job summary.
- Review upcoming procedural changes to ensure the overlap resolver still satisfies performance budgets when room counts increase.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated `PERF-119` with Session 87 telemetry tooling progress and refreshed next steps (delta comparisons, BSP monitoring).
- Advanced `QUEST-610` to in-progress with notes on the new scene scaffolding and trimmed outstanding steps to geometry + UI integration.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Latest baseline (2025-10-30T02:19:47.904Z, five runs): BSP average **3.9976 ms** (max 5.2376 ms); all metrics status `OK`.
- `telemetry-artifacts/performance/ci-baseline-summary.md` mirrors `docs/performance/performance-baseline-latest.md` and is uploaded during CI.
- RoomInstance instances now expose `layoutWidth/layoutHeight`; EntityPopulator and CaseGenerator consume these to keep placements inside rotated bounds while the overlap resolver enforces <5% major overlap rate.
