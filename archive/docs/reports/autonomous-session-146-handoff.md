# Autonomous Development Session #146 – Tutorial FX Hooks & Metrics Harness

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 25m  
**Focus**: Wire the tutorial overlay into the FX cue pipeline and stabilise the FX metrics Playwright harness with deterministic sampling helpers.

---

## Summary
- Instrumented `TutorialOverlay` to emit guarded `fx:overlay_cue` payloads for reveal/dismiss and step transitions, keeping onboarding beats aligned with HUD/particle feedback.
- Registered new tutorial cue identifiers across `FxCueCoordinator`, `FxOverlay`, and `CompositeCueParticleBridge`, mapping them to tuned durations, limits, and particle presets with expanded Jest coverage.
- Added `emitSyntheticSample` / `emitSyntheticWarning` helpers to `FxCueMetricsSampler` and refactored the FX metrics Playwright spec to rely on the new hooks, eliminating ad-hoc event bus injections and reducing flake risk.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/TutorialOverlay.js`
- `tests/game/ui/TutorialOverlay.test.js`
- `src/game/fx/FxCueCoordinator.js`
- `tests/game/fx/FxCueCoordinator.test.js`
- `src/game/fx/CompositeCueParticleBridge.js`
- `tests/game/fx/CompositeCueParticleBridge.test.js`
- `src/game/ui/FxOverlay.js`
- `tests/game/ui/FxOverlay.test.js`
- `src/game/fx/FxCueMetricsSampler.js`
- `tests/game/fx/FxCueMetricsSampler.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/debug-overlay-fx-metrics.spec.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/debug-overlay-fx-metrics.spec.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Re-run particle runtime stress tests once bespoke particle sheets land to validate throttling thresholds under final art loads.
2. Keep an eye on the refactored FX metrics Playwright scenario in CI; ensure future cue additions continue to expose deterministic sampler helpers before relying on automation.
3. Continue auditing remaining overlays (e.g., SaveInspector detail panels or future tutorial telemetry expansions) for optional FX cue hooks as narrative/UI requirements surface.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Marked `FX-242` and `QA-331` as **done** with completed work + verification notes in MCP.
- Added “Session #146 Backlog Updates” section to `docs/plans/backlog.md` reflecting the tutorial cue integration and FX metrics harness changes.

---

## Notes
- The new tutorial cue identifiers reuse existing quest/case visual treatments; revisit colour/shape palettes once bespoke tutorial FX arrive.
- Synthetic sampler helpers leave rolling averages untouched—ideal for automation, but avoid calling them in production code paths outside test/debug tooling.
