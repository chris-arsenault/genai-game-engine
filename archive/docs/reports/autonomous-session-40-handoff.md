# Autonomous Development Session #40 – Profiling Harness & Cipher Quartermaster

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h37m (Start 2025-10-28T16:00:00-07:00 – End 2025-10-28T17:37:15-07:00)  
**Status**: Profiling harness restored; vendor automation and Cipher quartermaster delivered.

---

## Executive Summary
- Repaired the broken performance profiling harness so `npm run profile` now executes `benchmark.js` and uses current ECS component APIs.
- Added a Playwright runtime smoke that simulates the Black Market Broker purchase flow, validating inventory metadata and credit deductions end-to-end.
- Introduced a Cipher Collective quartermaster vendor with currency/trade branches, updated Act 1 optional objectives, and synchronized narrative documentation.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Profiling Harness**: Pointed the `profile` script at `benchmark.js` and updated benchmark component registration to explicitly provide type names, unblocking PERF-214 (files `package.json`, `benchmark.js`).
- **Vendor Smoke Automation**: Authored `tests/e2e/vendor-black-market-flow.spec.js` to seed credits, execute dialogue choices, and assert inventory metadata/tags; confirmed no console errors during the run.
- **Cipher Quartermaster Vendor**: Added `DIALOGUE_CIPHER_QUARTERMASTER`, spawned the NPC in `Act1Scene`, linked an optional quest objective, and created companion Jest coverage plus character documentation (`src/game/data/dialogues/Act1Dialogues.js`, `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`, `src/game/data/quests/act1Quests.js`, `tests/game/data/Act1Dialogues.cipherQuartermaster.test.js`, `docs/narrative/characters/cipher-quartermaster.md`).
- **Backlog & Changelog Updates**: Marked PERF-214 as completed, recorded INV-318 for the quartermaster deliverable, and logged the new vendor/testing work in the changelog.

---

## Verification
- `npm run profile` → ✅ Pass; generated `benchmark-results/` JSON (cleaned after capture) and validated absence of module/component errors.
- `npm run test:e2e -- vendor-black-market-flow.spec.js` → ✅ Pass; runtime vendor purchase smoke succeeds with zero console errors.
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/data/Act1Dialogues.blackMarketVendor.test.js tests/game/data/Act1Dialogues.cipherQuartermaster.test.js` → ✅ Pass; dialogue metadata assertions hold for both vendors.

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Manual Runtime QA Pending**: Still need a `vite preview` or Playwright sweep covering broader HUD overlays with both vendors active to ensure no regressions outside the targeted smoke.
2. **Scrambler Gameplay Hook**: The new quartermaster item currently updates knowledge/flags but has no mechanical effect—requires integration with stealth/firewall systems before Act 1 infiltration beats land.
3. **Profiling Coverage**: Profiling harness now runs, but benchmarks only exercise engine workloads; schedule a follow-up run with vendor-heavy scenes once additional economy systems land.
4. **Session Duration**: Run time under 4h—loop closed early after completing the three required development tasks. Additional backlog items (e.g., quartermaster gameplay hooks) remain for next cycle.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Wire the Cipher scrambler metadata into Memory Parlor infiltration mechanics (stealth systems, firewall timers, quest gating).
2. Expand runtime QA: execute `npm test` full suite and a broader Playwright/regression pass including inventory overlays, disguises, and dialogue flows.
3. Extend vendor content pipeline (multiple stock items, UI listings) to leverage the new metadata structure before Act 2 economy beats.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 10 existing files updated; 3 new files added (Playwright spec, Jest spec, narrative character brief).
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 2 new Jest specs, 1 new Playwright smoke.
- **Verification Commands Executed**: `npm run profile`, targeted Playwright smoke, targeted Jest run.
- **Documentation**: Backlog, changelog, and character compendium updated; new handoff filed as `docs/reports/autonomous-session-40-handoff.md`.

---

## Notes
- Backlog entry INV-318 captures the quartermaster vendor work; PERF-214 marked complete following harness restoration.
- Profiling run artefacts (`benchmark-results/*`, V8 isolate logs) were generated for validation and removed post-verification to avoid repo noise.
- Session focused on previously flagged blockers (profiling) plus two feature increments to satisfy the “three development tasks” requirement.
