# Autonomous Development Session #30 – CORE-302 Audio Feedback Pass

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2.1 hours (2025-10-29T09:05:00-07:00 – 2025-10-29T11:11:00-07:00)  
**Status**: CORE-302 feedback loop progression ✅ audio + smoke hooks landed

---

## Executive Summary
- Introduced an `AudioFeedbackController` that bridges `player:moving`, `ui:show_prompt`, and `evidence:collected` events to shared SFX stubs through the engine `AudioManager`, satisfying CORE-302 acceptance criteria for audio/log feedback.
- Wired the controller into `Game.initializeAudioIntegrations`, ensuring the feedback loop only boots when audio is available and cleaning up during teardown.
- Authored unit coverage validating movement/prompt throttling and SFX dispatch, and added a Playwright smoke (`tests/e2e/feedback-overlays.spec.js`) that drives prompts/pulses while asserting audio hook timestamps.
- Updated backlog and changelog entries to reflect the new audio coverage and automation work.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Audio Hooks**: `src/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.js` now listens for movement, prompt, and evidence events, forwarding SFX IDs with per-channel throttling so overlays cannot spam sounds.
- **Game Integration**: `Game.js` exposes the engine `AudioManager`, instantiates the controller, and ensures cleanup, logging when audio is unavailable (useful for headless environments).
- **Testing**: Added Jest coverage (`tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js`) for throttling and event forwarding, plus a Playwright smoke that validates overlays + controller integration without needing manual browser QA.
- **Docs & Tracking**: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/plans/backlog.md` updated to capture the new deliverables and remaining polish follow-up on overlay styling.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js`
- `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/feedback-overlays.spec.js`

_Note_: Attempted `npx playwright install --with-deps`; installation aborted by an existing apt lock but browsers were already present so smoke ran successfully.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **HUD Palette Review** – Manual browser pass still needed to confirm prompts/pulses read cleanly against Act 1’s neon grid. Track UI feedback and adjust opacity/colors if UI/Narrative teams request tweaks.
2. **Audio Assets** – Current controller routes to `AudioManager.playSFX`, which remains a stub. Once actual audio buffers/IDs exist, ensure the manager returns gracefully when clips are missing and add assets to `assets/music/requests.json` / `assets/sfx` as needed.
3. **Playwright Dependencies** – CI may still need a reliable `npx playwright install` stage; today’s run succeeded without re-install, but resolve the apt lock before baking into automation.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Run manual browser smoke for CORE-302, gather screenshots, and tune overlay styling based on UX feedback.
2. Begin wiring audio asset loading or stub library in `AudioManager` so `AudioFeedbackController` plays audible cues during QA.
3. Kick off CORE-303 investigative loop integration once the feedback pass is signed off.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 6 (`src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.js`, `tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js`, `tests/e2e/feedback-overlays.spec.js`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`)
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 2 (`tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js`, `tests/e2e/feedback-overlays.spec.js`)
- **Automated Tests Run**: Jest targeted suite, Playwright feedback smoke
- **Manual QA**: Pending (palette & UX review)

---

## Notes
- The Playwright smoke leaves video + screenshot artifacts under `test-results/` during failures; we removed them from the repo but consider adding `.gitignore` coverage if the folder becomes noisy.
- The audio controller exposes `_lastMovementStamp` / `_lastPromptStamp` primarily for diagnostics; consider surfacing public getters if other systems need telemetry.
