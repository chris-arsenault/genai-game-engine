# Autonomous Development Session #19 – Dialogue & Tutorial Store Planning

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.11 hours (2025-10-28T09:17:27-07:00 – 2025-10-28T09:23:54-07:00)  
**Status**: Architecture plan drafted, implementation pending ⚠️

---

## Executive Summary
- Authored `docs/plans/dialogue-tutorial-store-plan.md`, defining the architecture for extending `WorldStateStore` with dialogue and enhanced tutorial slices plus selector-driven view models.
- Logged ADR `04e9d006-fce5-4811-87f1-3f31ec4c0fe9` formalizing the decision to migrate dialogue/tutorial overlays onto the store.
- Updated backlog PO-003 entry to reflect the new plan and clarify outstanding implementation work.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **New Plan**: `docs/plans/dialogue-tutorial-store-plan.md`
- **Backlog Update**: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (PO-003 progress note)
- **Architecture Decision**: `Extend WorldStateStore with dialogue and tutorial slices plus selector-driven overlays` (ADR ID `04e9d006-fce5-4811-87f1-3f31ec4c0fe9`)

---

## Verification
- No automated suites executed (documentation-only session).

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Implement store slices** – Build `dialogueSlice`, enhance `tutorialSlice`, wire `WorldStateStore` & SaveManager. Requires confirmation from narrative leads on transcript retention bounds.
2. **UI migration** – Refactor `DialogueBox`, add debug overlay, and migrate `TutorialOverlay` to selector-driven helpers once slice APIs land.
3. **Parity & performance tests** – Author Jest parity suites and update `benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js` per plan.
4. **Session duration** – Work paused early pending narrative sign-off on dialogue transcript scope; resume implementation once requirements confirmed.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Align with narrative team on dialogue transcript retention (history depth, save requirements) to unblock slice implementation.
2. Implement Phase 1 of the plan (store slices + tests) and validate via parity harness.
3. Begin UI refactor (Phase 2) focusing on `TutorialOverlay` migration, then tackle dialogue overlay & debug tooling.
4. Update benchmarks and Playwright scripts after selectors exist.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 2 (docs)
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 0
- **Known Failures**: None

---

## Notes
- Session constrained to architecture deliverable; further progress depends on clarifying narrative data retention expectations. Documented in backlog and ADR for follow-up.
