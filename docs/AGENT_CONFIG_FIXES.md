# Agent Configuration Fixes - 2025-10-25

## Problem Identified
Agents were reporting document creation but not actually writing files to disk.

## Root Cause
1. Agents lacked `Write` and `Edit` tools in their tool configurations
2. No explicit instructions to actually create files vs. describing them

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Tools to All Agents

Updated tool configurations for all 13 agents:
- ✅ `research-gameplay.md`
- ✅ `research-features.md`
- ✅ `research-engine.md`
- ✅ `architect.md`
- ✅ `narrative-writer.md`
- ✅ `narrative-world-building.md`
- ✅ `narrative-dialog.md`
- ✅ `documenter.md`
- ✅ `engine-dev.md`
- ✅ `gameplay-dev.md`
- ✅ `test-engineer.md`
- ✅ `optimizer.md`
- ✅ `playtester.md`

**Tools Added**:
- `Write` - Create new files
- `Edit` - Modify existing files
- `WebSearch` - For research agents (instead of deprecated `web_search`)
- `WebFetch` - For fetching documentation

### 2. Added Critical Instructions

Added explicit file creation instructions to all agents:

```markdown
## CRITICAL: File Creation Instructions

When assigned a task to create documentation or code:
1. **YOU MUST use the Write tool** to create new files
2. **YOU MUST use the Edit tool** to modify existing files
3. DO NOT just describe what you would write - actually write it
4. Files must be created in the paths specified in your task
5. Confirm file creation by noting the path in your response

If you fail to create files, the work is incomplete.
```

### 3. Created Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── plans/                  # Project planning documents
├── architecture/           # Technical architecture specs
├── research/              # Research findings
│   ├── gameplay/          # Gameplay research
│   ├── features/          # Feature research
│   └── engine/            # Engine research
├── narrative/             # Story and world
│   ├── lore/              # World lore
│   ├── factions/          # Faction details
│   ├── quests/            # Quest designs
│   ├── dialogue/          # Dialogue scripts
│   └── characters/        # Character profiles
└── reports/               # Session reports
```

## Verification

To verify agents now create files properly, re-run any agent with a documentation task:

```bash
# Example: Re-run research phase
/autonomous  # Will now create actual files
```

## Next Steps

1. Re-run the autonomous session or individual agents
2. Verify files are created in `docs/` directories
3. Agents should now:
   - Create files using Write tool
   - Modify files using Edit tool
   - Confirm file paths in responses
   - Maintain state through files, not just memory

## Testing

Test that an agent creates files:
```
Ask any agent to create a document and verify:
- File exists on disk
- Content matches agent's stated output
- Path is correct per agent configuration
```

## Notes

- All agent configs now enforce file creation
- Agents will fail their task if files aren't created
- Instructions are permanent part of agent configs
- Compatible with autonomous orchestration
