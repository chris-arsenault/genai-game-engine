# Autonomous Development Session #204 – AR-005 Seam Pipeline Expansion

**Date**: 2025-11-07  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~80m  
**Focus**: Extend the AR-005 seam automation workflow to the remaining districts and lock coverage with automated guards.

## Summary
- Ran the full analyze → promote → preview → validate automation stack for Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector tilesets, capturing promoted doorway metadata and preview summaries alongside cluster stats.
- Published seam manifests and preview reports for each atlas, surfacing 196/61/61 annotations and validating corridor readiness with zero warnings.
- Added Jest coverage to guard manifest counts and preview metrics, ensuring future promotions cannot regress doorway clusters or longest-span guarantees.

## Deliverables
- `reports/art/corporate-spires-tileset-analysis.json`
- `reports/art/archive-undercity-tileset-analysis.json`
- `reports/art/zenith-sector-tileset-analysis.json`
- `assets/manifests/tilesets/image-ar-005-tileset-corporate-spires-metadata.json`
- `assets/manifests/tilesets/image-ar-005-tileset-archive-undercity-metadata.json`
- `assets/manifests/tilesets/image-ar-005-tileset-zenith-sector-metadata.json`
- `reports/art/tileset-previews/image-ar-005-tileset-corporate-spires-preview.json`
- `reports/art/tileset-previews/image-ar-005-tileset-archive-undercity-preview.json`
- `reports/art/tileset-previews/image-ar-005-tileset-zenith-sector-preview.json`
- `tests/art/ar005TilesetSeamManifests.test.js`

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-005: District Tilesets (M4)** – Logged completion of the seam automation pipeline for Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector; updated next steps to focus on wiring the shared seam catalog into the runtime tileset preview UI.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Added Session 204 entry summarising the new analysis/manifests/previews, recorded cluster counts (153 / 30 / 2) and longest spans (14 / 8 / 41 tiles), and noted the new Jest guard.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Surface the consolidated seam preview catalog inside the runtime tileset preview UI and propagate Corporate Spires / Archive Undercity / Zenith Sector metadata through TemplateVariantResolver.
- Build any additional corridor tooling hooks that depend on the new seam manifests once the preview UI layer is ready.

## Verification
- `npm test`

## Metrics
- Corporate Spires: 196 doorway annotations, 153 clusters, longest span 14 tiles (orientation mix horizontal 148 / vertical 48, open-edge west 97 / east 51 / south 47 / north 1).
- Archive Undercity: 61 annotations, 30 clusters, longest span 8 tiles (vertical 56 / horizontal 5; open-edge south 33 / north 23 / west 4 / east 1).
- Zenith Sector: 61 annotations, 2 vertical mega-corridor clusters, longest span 41 tiles (all south-facing seams; average cluster length 30.5 tiles).
