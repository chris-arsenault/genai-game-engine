# Autonomous Development Session #101 - Crossroads Readiness & Diff Bundles
**Date**: November 9, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h10m  
**Status**: Art, narrative, and telemetry guardrails now report change deltas and readiness coverage so cross-discipline reviews can target the assets that actually moved.

---

## Highlights
- Act2Crossroads art validator now computes lighting/collision readiness, surfaces per-category coverage, and prints actionable summaries through the CLI.
- Act 2 branch dialogue exporter emits review bundles with Markdown plus JSON change reports so narrative/VO see only the anchors that changed.
- Quest telemetry parity checker ingests sample log batches, summarises schema coverage, and flags missing/unexpected fields before analytics ingestion.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/tools/Act2CrossroadsArtValidator.js`, `scripts/art/validateAct2CrossroadsArt.js`, `tests/game/tools/Act2CrossroadsArtValidator.test.js`
- `src/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.js`, `scripts/narrative/exportAct2BranchDialogues.js`, `tests/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.test.js`
- `src/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetrySchemaChecker.js`, `scripts/telemetry/checkQuestTelemetryParity.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetrySchemaChecker.test.js`
- Docs: `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/tools/Act2CrossroadsArtValidator.test.js tests/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.test.js tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetrySchemaChecker.test.js`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Crossroads readiness follow-up** – Run `npm run art:validate-crossroads --manifest=<latest>` to capture the lighting/collision readiness summary before the in-engine sweep; unresolved blockers feed directly to RenderOps.
2. **Narrative change review** – Generate diff-aware bundles via `npm run narrative:export-act2-branches --baseline <prev-summary> --changes-out <share>` so narrative/VO can review only modified anchors.
3. **Telemetry sample parity** – Aggregate the next quest telemetry drop with `npm run telemetry:check-parity --samples=<log-batch>.jsonl` to confirm schema coverage before analytics refresh approval.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Produce the Crossroads readiness report and coordinate any red segments with lighting/collision owners ahead of the walkthrough.
- Share the Markdown + change JSON bundle with narrative/VO reviewers and collect targeted copy approvals.
- Feed fresh quest telemetry samples through the parity CLI and record coverage metrics for analytics stakeholders.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated `QUEST-610` next steps, notes, and completed work with the readiness, diff bundle, and sample-ingest tooling; `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the refreshed focus.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Lighting readiness now tracks category totals vs. configured segments, calling out segments missing `lightingPreset`.
- Collision readiness highlights boundaries lacking `collisionProfile`/`nav_blocker`, giving designers early blockers before in-engine sweeps.
- Dialogue change reports list metadata deltas plus per-line modifications so reviewers can focus on specific anchors.
- Telemetry parity summary reports dataset/event/payload coverage percentages alongside unexpected field names for analytics QA.
