# Autonomous Development Session #142 – Narrative FX Cue Coordination

**Date**: November 11, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 20m  
**Focus**: Align dialogue and case progression with HUD FX cues while adding a coordination bridge for future particle layers.

---

## Summary
- `DialogueSystem` now emits `fx:overlay_cue` events for dialogue start, choices, beat transitions, and completion, with `FxOverlay` dialogue renderers ensuring conversations get distinct pulses and bursts.
- `CaseManager` broadcasts evidence/clue/objective/case milestones via new cue identifiers feeding both overlay treatments and composite consumers, backed by expanded unit coverage.
- Introduced `FxCueCoordinator` to throttle and rebroadcast cues (`fx:composite_cue`), added effect caps in `FxOverlay`, and updated `Game` lifecycle so FX pipelines stay within budget.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/systems/DialogueSystem.js`
- `src/game/managers/CaseManager.js`
- `src/game/ui/FxOverlay.js`
- `src/game/Game.js`
- `src/game/fx/FxCueCoordinator.js`
- Tests: `tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/CaseManager.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/FxOverlay.test.js`, `tests/game/fx/FxCueCoordinator.test.js`
- Documentation: `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/ui/FxOverlay.test.js tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js tests/game/managers/CaseManager.test.js tests/game/fx/FxCueCoordinator.test.js`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Hook upcoming particle/post-processing pipelines to `fx:composite_cue`, using the coordinator concurrency metrics to decide composite treatments.
2. Run in-scene performance sampling (debug overlay + coordinator metrics) to confirm cue throughput stays under the 16 ms budget during busy quest/forensic/dialogue sequences.
3. Evaluate other narrative surfaces (CaseFileUI, QuestLogUI, dialogue overlays) for secondary FX cues to ensure consistent messaging beyond dialogue/case systems.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Created and closed MCP backlog item `FX-236` capturing the narrative FX cue coordination work and mirrored the update in `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session #142).

---

## Notes
- `FxCueCoordinator.getMetrics()` exposes drop/defer counts for future telemetry hooks; consider wiring this into the performance profiler once particle layers attach.
- `FxOverlay` caps concurrent overlays at 10; adjust via `maxConcurrentEffects` if future polish layers require additional headroom.
