# Autonomous Development Session #208 – Backlog Automation Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-11-10  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Normalize backlog status, enforce automation-only follow-ups, and align documentation/TODOs without delivering new content.

## Summary
- Reviewed outstanding backlog items and converted CORE-301 to review-approved, locking the scene against automated palette/Jest/Playwright guards instead of manual checks.
- Refreshed the "Next Session Focus" TODO list to carry forward Act 3 narrative follow-ups and prioritized AR-050 automation runs from grooming.
- Replaced residual manual verification guidance (e.g., dev-server smoke) with explicit automated suites inside docs/plans/backlog.md.

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Updated Next Session Focus bullets, CORE-301 status language, and automation-only guidance for PO-001 follow-ups.
- `docs/reports/autonomous-session-208-handoff.md`

## Backlog Updates
- **CORE-301: Act 1 Scene Visual Bring-Up** (`a8aa427b-ef69-422e-8422-001dbdf546af`) – Status marked review-approved with next steps pointing solely to the Jest/Playwright automation guardrails; notes clarify no manual scene checks remain.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Added narrative carry-over items to the TODO queue, rewrote PO-001 next steps to cite automated suites, and highlighted automation ownership for CORE-301.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Extend Act 3 narrative coverage to the `main-act3-gathering-support` questline with automation-ready quest/dialogue hooks.
- Author stance-based epilogues that feed finale cinematics while keeping narrative exports covered by scripted validation.
- Execute the 2025-11-07 AR-050 bespoke pipeline run (track-bespoke → export-crossroads-luminance) and fold the artifacts into manifests/reports automatically.

## Verification
- Not run (documentation/backlog-only session; no automated suites executed).

## Metrics
- Backlog hygiene: 1 MCP backlog item transitioned to review-approved with automation-only next steps.
