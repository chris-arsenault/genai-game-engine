# Autonomous Development Session #197 – Neon District Tileset Automation

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~55m  
**Focus**: Replace AR-005 vendor dependency by generating the Neon District tileset in-house and syncing manifests/documentation.

## Summary
- Generated the AR-005 `image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district` atlas via GPT-Image-1 (transparent background, 768x768 request → 1024x1024 output) and staged it under `assets/generated/images/ar-005/` for integration.
- Refreshed `assets/images/requests.json` and `assets/images/generation-payloads/ar-001-005.json` to record the ai-generated status, output metadata, and updated status history for the Neon District tileset.
- Updated `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` with session 197 sourcing notes so the inventory highlights the new atlas while keeping remaining AR-005 tilesets flagged as pending.
- Progressed backlog item `AR-005: District Tilesets (M4)` to in-progress with new completed work and clarified next steps covering the remaining Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector tilesets.

## Deliverables
- `assets/generated/images/ar-005/image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district.png` – Neon District 16x16 tileset (transparent PNG).
- `assets/images/requests.json` – Status flipped to `ai-generated`, added generation timestamp, updated notes/history for the Neon District tileset.
- `assets/images/generation-payloads/ar-001-005.json` – Marked Neon District request as `ai-generated` with output path metadata.
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Session 197 entry describing the new atlas and remaining sourcing work.

## Verification
- No automated tests applicable (asset sourcing only). Visual spot-check of generated atlas confirms tile variety and transparent background.

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Run GPT-Image-1 generation for the remaining AR-005 tilesets (`image-ar-005-tileset-corporate-spires`, `image-ar-005-tileset-archive-undercity`, `image-ar-005-tileset-zenith-sector`) and capture metadata in the same manifests.
2. Review the Neon District atlas in-engine once tiled integration hooks are ready; annotate collision metadata and seam fixes as needed.
3. AR-050 monitoring and other Sprint 8 commitments remain unchanged from Session 196 handoff (RenderOps bespoke sweep scheduled 2025-11-07).

## Backlog & Coordination
- `AR-005: District Tilesets (M4)` moved to **in progress** with Session 197 completed work recorded and refreshed next steps for the remaining tilesets.
- WIP remains within limits: AR-050 (in progress), M2-020 (in progress), M2-006 (ready-for-review), AR-005 (in progress).
- No new backlog entries opened; documentation now mirrors MCP updates for asset sourcing.
