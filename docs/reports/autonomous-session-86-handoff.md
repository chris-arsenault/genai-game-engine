# Autonomous Development Session #86 - Performance Guardrails & Act 2 Trigger Seeds
**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h00m  
**Status**: Established telemetry guardrail tooling, captured the first baseline summary, and pre-seeded Act 2 hub trigger metadata with regression coverage.

---

## Highlights
- Added `scripts/telemetry/summarizePerformanceBaseline.js` with Jest coverage plus the `telemetry:performance:summary` npm alias, enabling markdown guardrail reports and warning surfacing for baseline spikes.
- Ran the five-run baseline (`telemetry:performance:baseline -- --runs 5`) and published retention/alert policies in `docs/performance/performance-baseline-guardrails.md`, generating a live snapshot at `docs/performance/performance-baseline-latest.md` (BSP peaks exceeded the 10 ms cap once, now tracked as a warning).
- Seeded Act 2 Crossroads trigger definitions via `ACT2_CROSSROADS_TRIGGER_DEFINITIONS`, ensured `QuestTriggerRegistry` preloads them, extended TriggerMigrationToolkit to propagate metadata onto Quest components, and documented the migration path in `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`.

---

## Deliverables
- Telemetry guardrails: `scripts/telemetry/summarizePerformanceBaseline.js`, `tests/scripts/telemetry/summarizePerformanceBaseline.test.js`, `package.json`, `docs/performance/performance-baseline-guardrails.md`, `docs/performance/performance-baseline-latest.md`, `docs/tech/world-state-store.md`.
- Quest tooling: `src/game/data/quests/act2TriggerDefinitions.js`, `src/game/quests/QuestTriggerRegistry.js`, `src/game/quests/TriggerMigrationToolkit.js`, `tests/game/quests/Act2TriggerDefinitions.test.js`, `tests/game/quests/TriggerMigrationToolkit.test.js`, `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md`.
- Backlog sync: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (PERF-119 progress + new QUEST-610 entry), MCP backlog updates (`PERF-119`, newly created `QUEST-610`).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/scripts/telemetry/summarizePerformanceBaseline.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/quests/Act2TriggerDefinitions.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/quests/TriggerMigrationToolkit.test.js`
- `npm test` (fails on known procedural generation assertions: `tests/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.test.js` overlap thresholds and `getTile` helper expectations; unchanged this session).

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **CI guardrail integration** - Wire `telemetry:performance:summary` into the GitHub Actions baseline job so markdown reports accompany the JSON artifact and warnings surface automatically (`PERF-119` next step).
2. **BSP spike follow-up** - Investigate the 12.46 ms peak recorded in the latest baseline; confirm if it is noise or requires BSP tuning before thresholds tighten.
3. **Act 2 trigger migration** - Crossroads scene still needs geometry plus toolkit wiring so seeded definitions transition from outstanding to migrated (`QUEST-610`).
4. **Procedural overlaps** - DistrictGenerator overlap/bounds tests continue to fail; schedule remediation or adjust test tolerances once manifest updates stabilize.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Automate markdown guardrail publishing in CI and add delta comparison once multiple baseline history entries exist.
- Begin scaffolding the Act 2 Crossroads scene, attaching toolkit-backed triggers and extending Jest coverage per the new authoring notes.
- Address DistrictGenerator regression failures or log waivers before the next manifest iteration.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- **PERF-119** progressed to in-progress with the new summary tooling, retention/alert policy, and live baseline snapshot; next steps updated to focus on CI integration and delta tracking.
- **QUEST-610** created to track Act 2 Crossroads trigger migration, referencing seeded definitions, coverage, and documentation.

## Metrics & Notes
- Five-run baseline (2025-10-30T01:51:29.522Z):
  - Forensic analysis avg **0.0337 ms** (max 0.1467 ms) vs threshold 4 ms - OK.
  - Faction reputation modify avg **0.0030 ms** (max 0.0072 ms) vs threshold 2 ms - OK.
  - Faction attitude lookup avg **0.0002 ms** (max 0.0007 ms) vs threshold 0.05 ms - OK.
  - BSP generation avg **5.4662 ms** (max 12.4603 ms) vs threshold 10 ms - WARNING due to peak exceeding cap; average utilisation 54.66%.
- Quest components now capture registry metadata (e.g., `branchingChoice`, `telemetryTag`) for downstream UI/telemetry systems; outstanding migration reports include Act 2 seeds until the scene attaches them.
- Guardrail history retention policy established: keep 14 baseline aggregates under `telemetry-artifacts/performance/history/`, prune weekly, attach any warning/critical runs to `PERF-119`.
