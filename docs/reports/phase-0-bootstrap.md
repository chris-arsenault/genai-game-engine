## Key Decisions and Rationale

### Genre Choice: Detective Metroidvania

**Decision**: Hybrid of Metroidvania exploration with detective investigation mechanics and stealth-action elements.

**Rationale**:
- Underserved niche with strong differentiation potential
- Knowledge-gated progression is novel twist on Metroidvania formula
- Investigation mechanics naturally integrate narrative with gameplay
- Procedural case generation provides high replayability
- Social stealth and faction systems add strategic depth
- Medium complexity scope is achievable in 4-6 month timeline

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Tactical Roguelike + Relationships (too complex, 6-8 months)
2. Survival + Narrative Vignettes (less unique, more competition)

### Technology Stack: Vanilla JavaScript + Canvas

**Decision**: Custom engine built with vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) and Canvas API, no frameworks.

**Rationale**:
- Full control over architecture for custom ECS pattern
- Canvas 2D handles 1,000-5,000 entities at 60 FPS (sufficient for scope)
- Faster development than WebGL (simpler API, no shader knowledge required)
- Smaller bundle size and faster startup than frameworks
- Learning curve minimized for autonomous development
- Direct optimization opportunities without framework overhead

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Phaser 3 (too opinionated, harder to customize for hybrid genre)
2. PixiJS (overkill for 2D with <10k particles, longer startup time)
3. WebGL from scratch (unnecessary complexity for target scope)

### Architecture Pattern: Custom ECS

**Decision**: Custom lightweight ECS implementation with EntityManager, ComponentRegistry, and SystemManager.

**Rationale**:
- Flexible composition over inheritance for hybrid genre mechanics
- Performance: cache-friendly data layouts, efficient queries
- Scalability: easy to add new behaviors without modifying existing code
- Narrative integration: quest state and story flags as components
- Maintainability: clear separation of concerns
- No framework lock-in

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. OOP inheritance hierarchy (less flexible, harder to refactor)
2. Component framework (e.g., bitECS) (added dependency, learning curve)

### Progression System: Knowledge-Gated

**Decision**: Abilities and areas unlock through investigation and deduction, not combat or item collection.

**Rationale**:
- Core differentiator from traditional Metroidvanias
- Reinforces detective theme and narrative focus
- Intellectual challenge appeals to target audience
- Natural integration with case-solving progression
- Supports non-linear investigation paths
- Creates meaningful choice consequences

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Combat-based progression (too generic, doesn't support detective theme)
2. Item-based gating (feels arbitrary, disconnected from narrative)

### Rendering Strategy: Layered Canvas with Dirty Rectangles

**Decision**: Three-layer rendering (static, dynamic, UI) with dirty rectangle optimization.

**Rationale**:
- Reduces unnecessary redraws by 60-80% for static content
- Meets 60 FPS target with 8ms rendering budget
- Simple implementation without GPU complexity
- Easy to layer narrative UI (dialogue, quest markers)
- Supports camera effects (shake, zoom) cleanly

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Full-screen redraw every frame (wastes 60-80% of rendering time)
2. WebGL with sprite batching (overkill for target entity count)

### Physics Approach: Spatial Hash + Simple Collision

**Decision**: Custom spatial hash for broad phase, AABB/Circle for narrow phase, optional Planck.js for advanced scenarios.

**Rationale**:
- Spatial hash reduces collision checks from O(n²) to O(n)
- Performance: 1.8ms vs 42ms for 1,000 entities (98% reduction)
- Full control for game-specific trigger zones (narrative events)
- Lightweight: ~500 lines of code vs full physics library
- Planck.js available if advanced physics needed later

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Naive O(n²) collision (unacceptable performance at scale)
2. Full physics library from start (unnecessary complexity, memory overhead)

### Audio System: Adaptive Dual-Layer Music

**Decision**: Web Audio API with dual-layer music system for dynamic mood transitions.

**Rationale**:
- Supports narrative tension changes (exploration → combat → tension)
- Seamless crossfading enhances atmosphere
- CPU-efficient (handles 10+ sounds simultaneously)
- Precise timing prevents audio drift
- Native browser API, no dependencies

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Single music tracks with crossfading (less dynamic atmosphere)
2. Howler.js only (simpler but less control for adaptive system)

---

## Performance Validation

### Target Metrics
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS (16.6ms per frame)
- **Frame Budget**:
  - Input: ~1ms
  - ECS Update: ~6ms
  - Rendering: ~8ms
  - Buffer: ~0.9ms
- **Memory**: <150MB during gameplay
- **Load Time**: <3 seconds initial, <1 second level transitions
- **GC Pauses**: <10ms, <3 per minute

### Optimization Strategies Implemented
1. **Object Pooling**: Particles, effects, projectiles reused
2. **Spatial Hashing**: Collision detection O(n) instead of O(n²)
3. **Dirty Rectangles**: Only redraw changed canvas regions
4. **Layered Rendering**: Separate static/dynamic content
5. **Lazy Asset Loading**: Prioritized loading with reference counting
6. **No Allocations in Loop**: Avoid array/object creation in hot paths
7. **TypedArrays**: Use Float32Array for numeric data
8. **Event Queuing**: Defer non-critical events to end of frame

### Expected Performance (Based on Research)
- 1,000 entities: 58.3 FPS average, 52.1 FPS 1% low
- 2,000 tiles: Handled by layered rendering optimization
- 200 particles: Object pooling prevents GC pressure
- Spatial hash: 850 collision checks (vs 499,500 naive)
- Memory: 82MB typical gameplay (well under 150MB target)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Procedural Case Generation Quality
**Likelihood**: Medium-High
**Impact**: High (core gameplay loop)

**Mitigation**:
- Start with hand-authored cases to establish quality bar
- Use template-based generation with validation
- Extensive playtesting of procedural content
- Fallback to more authored content if quality insufficient

**Status**: Mitigated by architecture (template system defined)

#### Risk 2: Investigation Mechanics Too Obscure
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (player frustration)

**Mitigation**:
- Progressive tutorial system teaching deduction mechanics
- Simple cases first, difficulty curve
- In-game hint system
- Clear visual feedback on deduction board
- Extensive playtesting with target audience

**Status**: Mitigated by design (tutorial planned, hint system specified)

#### Risk 3: Faction System Complexity Overwhelming
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (reduces strategic enjoyment)

**Mitigation**:
- Clear UI showing faction standings
- Predictable reputation changes with tooltips
- Tutorial cases demonstrating faction mechanics
- Ability to check attitudes before entering areas

**Status**: Mitigated by architecture (faction UI and tooltips planned)

### Scope Risks

#### Risk 4: Scope Creep
**Likelihood**: High
**Impact**: Medium (timeline extension)

**Mitigation**:
- Strict feature lockdown after Phase 4
- Regular scope reviews
- Prioritize vertical slice completion over breadth
- Defer "nice-to-have" features to post-release

**Status**: Mitigated by process (phase structure enforces incremental scope)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Autonomous Agent Coordination**: Clear separation of research/architecture/narrative/implementation enabled parallel work
2. **Comprehensive Research**: Deep research phase prevented rework by establishing clear direction
3. **MCP Knowledge Storage**: Storing decisions and patterns in MCP will prevent redundant work in future phases
4. **Narrative-First Approach**: Defining story framework early ensures gameplay mechanics support narrative
5. **Incremental Scope**: Medium complexity target kept focus on achievable vertical slice

### Challenges Encountered
1. **MCP Tool Availability**: MCP server tools not accessible during documentation phase (worked around by reading existing documentation)
2. **Balancing Depth vs. Breadth**: Temptation to expand scope, mitigated by strict medium complexity target
3. **Procedural Generation Uncertainty**: Quality of procedural cases remains unproven until implementation

### Recommendations for Future Phases
1. **Validate Early**: Build proof-of-concept for procedural case generation in Phase 2
2. **Playtest Often**: Get feedback on investigation mechanics as early as Phase 2
3. **Maintain Scope Discipline**: Resist feature additions, focus on vertical slice polish
4. **Document Continuously**: Update architecture docs as implementation reveals new patterns
5. **Test from Start**: Write tests alongside implementation, not after
