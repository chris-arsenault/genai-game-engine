# Autonomous Development Session #216 – Finale Cinematic Path Alignment

**Date**: 2025-11-16  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~65m  
**Focus**: Validate the Act 3 finale cinematic presentation in automation, resolve static asset path warnings, and keep the ForensicSystem performance guard under watch.

## Summary
- Exercised the Act 3 finale Playwright scenario, observed Vite publicDir warnings for `/assets/...` URLs, and normalized the cinematic manifest entries to root-served `/overlays/...` paths.
- Re-ran the finale E2E after the manifest update, confirming narration/beat sequencing with clean output.
- Executed the ForensicSystem Jest suite to monitor the <6 ms guard; no regressions detected.

## Deliverables
- `assets/manifests/act3-finale-cinematics.json`, `src/game/data/narrative/act3FinaleCinematicManifestData.js` — Updated finale cinematic asset references to use `/overlays/...` URLs compatible with Vite `publicDir`.
- `tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicAssetManager.test.js` — Expectations refreshed to assert the new root-served asset paths.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Logged Session 216 outcomes and refreshed next steps for the Act 3 Narrative epic.

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`): Added Session 216 accomplishments to `completed_work`, replaced the fulfilled Playwright/ForensicSystem follow-ups with new next steps covering asset URL audits and expanded finale stance automation.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Audit other static asset manifests for lingering `/assets/` URL prefixes to prevent future Vite publicDir warnings.
- Extend Playwright coverage to assert finale hero/beat art swaps correctly for the support and alternative stance branches.

## Verification
- `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/systems/ForensicSystem.test.js`

## Metrics
- Manifest entries normalized: 12 finale cinematic hero/beat assets.
- Automated suites executed: 1 Playwright spec, 1 targeted Jest suite.
