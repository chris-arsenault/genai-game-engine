# Autonomous Development Session #242 – CaseManager Objective Completion
**Date**: 2025-11-26  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~65m  
**Focus**: Close backlog item M2-004 by wiring theory validation objectives into CaseManager and refreshing automation coverage.

## Summary
- Extended `CaseManager` with centralized objective completion helpers, accuracy-threshold resolution, and automatic `validate_theory` handling during solve flows.
- Augmented `CaseManager` Jest coverage to assert theory objectives complete with accuracy metadata and that final-case events emit correctly.
- Synced documentation/backlog to note M2-004 completion and cleared the dependency blocker for M2-005’s deduction board UI workstream.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/CaseManager.js`
- `tests/game/managers/CaseManager.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- `npm test` *(CLI timeout after reporting all suites PASS; follow-up targeted run executed for confirmation)*
- `npm test -- CaseManager`

## Backlog Updates
- `M2-004: Case File Manager` → `done` (theory validation objective completion, shared event helper, refreshed Jest coverage).

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Launch `M2-005: Deduction Board UI (Basic)` implementation now that CaseManager exposes the required events; ensure drag/drop and connection flows ship with Jest automation.
- Keep `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton` staged for quest plumbing integration and expand Playwright coverage once deduction UI hooks land.
- Maintain weekly automation sweeps for `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` and keep faction ECS groundwork (`M3-003`) ready pending upstream data contracts.
