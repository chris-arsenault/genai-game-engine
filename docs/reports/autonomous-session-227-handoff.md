# Autonomous Development Session #227 – Act 3 Finale Shared Memory Well Art

**Date**: 2025-11-21  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Generate a shared Act 3 finale overlay to bridge stance epilogues and sync asset inventory/manifests.

## MCP Status
- `game-mcp-server` responded normally; backlog item **Act 3 Narrative** updated with Session 227 asset sourcing progress and new sequencing follow-up.

## Summary
- Authored a unified Act 3 finale memory well visual that captures converging stance outcomes, emphasising Kira guiding memory streams toward the city.
- Staged the transparent overlay in both generated and runtime overlay directories, extended the finale cinematic manifest with a `sharedPanels` entry, and registered sourcing metadata across docs.
- Recorded the new asset in `assets/images/requests.json` under `AR-060` and refreshed `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` to surface the shared finale panel.

## Deliverables
- `assets/generated/act3-finale/act3_finale_shared_memory_well.png` — GPT-Image asset depicting the shared memory well convergence moment.
- `assets/overlays/act3-finale/shared/act3_finale_shared_memory_well.png` — runtime-ready transparent overlay for FinaleCinematicOverlay sequencing.
- `assets/manifests/act3-finale-cinematics.json` — appended `sharedPanels` metadata pointing to the new asset with descriptive tags/palette.
- `assets/images/requests.json` — added `image-ar-060-shared-memory-well` entry with status history and sourcing details.
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` — documented `AR-060` and noted Session 227 additions.

## Commands Executed
- `mcp__generate-image__generate_image` (act3_finale_shared_memory_well)

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`): Logged the shared finale panel delivery and set a follow-up to integrate it into FinaleCinematicOverlay sequencing with automated coverage.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Integrate the shared memory well panel into the finale cinematic flow and extend tests/E2E coverage once scripted.
- Monitor future finale art/audio sync passes to ensure the shared overlay aligns with stance transitions.

## Verification
- No automated tests required for this asset-only update; visual inspection pending during next cinematic validation run.

## Metrics
- GPT-Image output: 1024×1024 transparent PNG (~2.1 MB).
