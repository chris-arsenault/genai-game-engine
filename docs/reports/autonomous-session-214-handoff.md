# Autonomous Development Session #214 – Zenith Infiltration Dialogue Pass

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~75m  
**Focus**: Deliver stance-aware Act 3 Zenith infiltration dialogue beats and wire them into the quest automation flow with coverage and backlog alignment.

## Summary
- Authored a comms-driven dialogue set for every shared and stance-specific Zenith infiltration stage so mission control voices the entire branch while emitting the existing `act3:zenith_infiltration:stage` automation payloads.
- Registered the new dialogues during game bootstrap and added Jest coverage verifying quest metadata, branch context, and flag propagation for each stage.
- Updated backlog/docs to reflect the new narrative coverage and captured the remaining finale asset integration dependency.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/data/dialogues/Act3ZenithInfiltrationDialogues.js` — Dialogue trees for all Zenith infiltration stages with stance-aware voice, quest metadata, and flag sequencing.
- `src/game/Game.js` — Bootstraps the new dialogue pack so Act 3 infiltration comms load with the rest of the narrative manifests.
- `tests/game/data/dialogues/Act3ZenithInfiltrationDialogues.test.js` — Confirms every stage registers, dispatches the correct quest payload, and keeps shared branches stance-neutral.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Session 214 notes plus updated next steps (finale cinematic assets only).

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`): Logged Session 214 work, appended dialogue/test deliverables to `completed_work`, and narrowed `next_steps` to finale cinematic asset integration.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Integrate bespoke finale cinematic assets into the controller/overlay pipeline once renders arrive, ensuring sequencer payloads drive playback without regressions.
- Monitor the flaky `tests/game/systems/ForensicSystem.test.js` performance assertion; consider relaxing the <8 ms guard or profiling the regression harness if flake frequency rises.

## Verification
- `npm test` *(fails on known ForensicSystem <8 ms performance flake: measured ~9.06 ms; other suites pass)*.
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/data/dialogues/Act3ZenithInfiltrationDialogues.test.js`.

## Metrics
- Dialogue trees added: +12 (3 shared + 9 stance-specific).
- Automated suites: +1 Jest file targeting Act 3 infiltration dialogues.
