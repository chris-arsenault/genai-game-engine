# Autonomous Development Session #219 – Memory Parlor Overlay Automation

**Date**: 2025-11-18  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~55m  
**Focus**: Automate the Memory Parlor neon overlay derivative and refresh supporting art documentation/backlog records.

## Summary
- Added `image-memory-parlor-neon-001` to the overlay derivative config and exported `assets/overlays/act2-crossroads/memory_parlor_neon_001.png` to unblock the Memory Parlor lighting pass.
- Logged luminance statistics (`avgLuma 37.3`, `avgAlpha 85.3`, `peakAlpha 240`) via the overlay analysis script and regenerated the Act 2 Crossroads luminance snapshot (12/12 segments OK).
- Promoted the Memory Parlor request to `derivative-generated` status, updated `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, and synced AR-050 backlog metadata with the new automation outputs.

## Deliverables
- `assets/images/overlay-derivatives-act2-crossroads.json` — appended Memory Parlor overlay entry with tuned brightness/tint/alpha operations.
- `assets/overlays/act2-crossroads/memory_parlor_neon_001.png` — generated derivative plate for Memory Parlor infiltration beats.
- `assets/images/requests.json` — request `image-memory-parlor-neon-001` marked `derivative-generated` with recorded automation metrics.
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` & `docs/plans/backlog.md` — documented the automation run, updated next steps, and captured verification details.
- `reports/art/luminance-snapshots/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-luminance-2025-11-01T04-38-24-648Z.{json,md}` — refreshed tolerance snapshot confirming all segments in range.

## Commands Executed
- `npm run art:generate-crossroads-overlays -- --filter image-memory-parlor-neon-001`
- `node scripts/art/analyzeCrossroadsOverlays.js --dir assets/generated/ar-050`
- `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** (`3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`): cleared the Memory Parlor derivative follow-ups, appended session 219 to `completed_work`, set `next_steps` to focus on in-engine integration checks, and added a 2025-11-18 note about the refreshed luminance snapshot.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Integrate `memory_parlor_neon_001` into the Memory Parlor infiltration composite and confirm the lighting pass in the next automation sweep.
- Run the standard art automation regression bundle once the integration lands to keep tolerance reports current.

## Verification
- Overlay derivative generation (`npm run art:generate-crossroads-overlays -- --filter image-memory-parlor-neon-001`)
- Overlay luminance analysis (`node scripts/art/analyzeCrossroadsOverlays.js --dir assets/generated/ar-050`)
- Luminance snapshot export (`npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`)

## Metrics
- Memory Parlor overlay: `avgLuma 37.3`, `avgAlpha 85.3`, `peakAlpha 240`, `high@220+ = 1.5%`, `low@<=64 = 0%`.
- Act 2 Crossroads luminance sweep: 12/12 segments within tolerance.
