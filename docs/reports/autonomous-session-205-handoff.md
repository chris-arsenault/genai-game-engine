# Autonomous Development Session #205 – AR-005 Seam Catalog Runtime Wiring

**Date**: 2025-11-08  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~85m  
**Focus**: Surface the consolidated AR-005 seam catalog inside runtime tooling and propagate multi-atlas metadata through TemplateVariantResolver.

## Summary
- Froze seam preview catalogs for Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector alongside the existing Neon District data, aggregating them via `tilesetSeamPreviewCatalog` so TemplateVariantResolver and downstream systems receive a unified atlas feed.
- Updated TemplateVariantResolver metadata plumbing and CorridorSeamPainter fallbacks to expose catalog references (tileset + activeTilesetId), ensuring corridor tooling can leverage multi-atlas seam clusters without reparsing JSON at runtime.
- Extended the debug overlay with a Tileset Seam Catalog panel that reports annotations, cluster counts, longest spans, and orientation/open-edge distributions for every AR-005 atlas.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/procedural/templates/corporateSpiresSeamPreview.js`
- `src/game/procedural/templates/archiveUndercitySeamPreview.js`
- `src/game/procedural/templates/zenithSectorSeamPreview.js`
- `src/game/procedural/templates/tilesetSeamPreviewCatalog.js`
- `src/game/procedural/templates/authoredTemplates.js`
- `src/game/procedural/CorridorSeamPainter.js`
- `index.html`
- `src/main.js`
- `tests/game/procedural/templates/neonDistrictSeamPreview.test.js`
- `tests/game/procedural/templates/tilesetSeamPreviewCatalog.test.js`

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-005: District Tilesets (M4)** – Logged the runtime seam catalog wiring, added catalog helper deliverables to completed work, and retargeted next steps toward district-driven activeTilesetId selection plus downstream corridor validation dashboards.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Added Session 205 entry covering the frozen seam catalogs, catalog helper, and debug overlay integration.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Refreshed AR-005 status/next steps to reflect the runtime catalog wiring and upcoming district-specific seam selection work.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Drive active tileset selection through DistrictGenerator/template configuration so runtime placements tag the appropriate atlas metadata instead of defaulting to Neon District.
- Feed the seam catalog stats into corridor validation dashboards once district-driven selection lands, surfacing metadata mismatches automatically.

## Verification
- `npm test`

## Metrics
- Catalog now spans 4 atlases / 426 doorway annotations with longest span 41 tiles (Zenith Sector) and Corporate Spires reporting 153 doorway clusters (longest 14 tiles), Archive Undercity 30 clusters (longest 8 tiles), Neon District 52 clusters (longest 19 tiles).
