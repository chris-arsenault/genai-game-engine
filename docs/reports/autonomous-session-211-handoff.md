# Autonomous Development Session #211 – Finale Sequencer Bridge

**Date**: 2025-11-17  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~90m  
**Focus**: Gate Act 3 finale cinematics on Zenith infiltration completion and keep automation/docs aligned.

## Summary
- Introduced `Act3FinaleCinematicSequencer` to translate `act3_zenith_infiltration_complete` plus stance flags into a unified `narrative:finale_cinematic_ready` payload sourced from the Act 3 epilogue library.
- Wired the sequencer into `Game` initialisation/cleanup so finale readiness is broadcast once per run and survives restored saves without duplicate listeners.
- Documented the runtime hook in Act 3 quest notes, refreshed backlog tracking, and expanded Jest coverage to assert gating, cold-start dispatch, and reset behaviour.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicSequencer.js`: Runtime sequencer bridging epilogue stance data to finale cinematic events, handling flag changes and duplicate suppression.
- `src/game/Game.js`: Registers/disposes the sequencer inside `initializeNarrativeControllers` and game cleanup so finale readiness is available to downstream systems.
- `tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicSequencer.test.js`: Exercised infiltration completion, pre-set flags, and flag toggle flows to guard the new sequencing behaviour.
- `docs/narrative/quests/act-3-quests.md`: Added Session 211 implementation notes describing the finale readiness event and coverage.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Logged the new work under Session 211 and updated Act 3 Narrative next steps.

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`) — Added Session 211 progress entry, replaced finale-sequencer next step with dialogue/playwright follow-ups, and recorded new Jest coverage.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Author stance-specific Zenith infiltration dialogue beats/prompts once layouts stabilise.
- Integrate the finale cinematic playback/presentation layer that consumes the sequencer payload when assets land.
- Schedule Playwright coverage for the Zenith route to validate trigger sequencing through `narrative:finale_cinematic_ready`.

## Verification
- `npm test`

## Metrics
- Runtime events: 1 new narrative finale sequencer emitting `narrative:finale_cinematic_ready`.
- Automation: 1 new Jest suite (3 tests) covering finale gating/resets.
