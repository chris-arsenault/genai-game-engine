# Autonomous Development Session #199 – Tileset Automation & Perf Benchmarks

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~75m  
**Focus**: Automate the remaining AR-005 tileset queue, stage Neon District seam/collision analysis, and extend M2-020 performance monitoring with scripted benchmarks.

## Summary
- Queued the Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector tilesets via `scripts/art/queueGenerationRequests.js`, updating `assets/images/requests.json` with generation metadata and recording the run in `assets/images/generation-queue/2025-10-31T22-51-38-840Z-ar-005.jsonl`.
- Authored `scripts/art/analyzeTilesetSeams.js` (`npm run art:analyze-tileset`) to scan 4096 tiles from the Neon District atlas; produced `reports/art/neon-district-tileset-analysis.json` with 795 solid tiles, 475 mixed tiles, and 108 seam/collision warnings earmarked for metadata triage.
- Implemented `scripts/benchmarks/runLayoutGraphBenchmark.js` (`npm run benchmark:layout-graph`) and captured `reports/perf/layout-graph-benchmark-2025-10-31.json`, confirming 60/120/180-node runs stay ≤1.35 ms max; archived a fresh investigation profiling sweep at `benchmark-results/m1-profile-1761951451560.json`.
- Updated backlog/docs to highlight the new automation, refreshed next steps for AR-005 and M2-020, and documented the new tooling in `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` and `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

## Deliverables
- `assets/images/generation-queue/2025-10-31T22-51-38-840Z-ar-005.jsonl` – AI queue payload for the remaining AR-005 tilesets.
- `assets/images/requests.json` – Manifest entries flipped to `generation-queued` with queue metadata for Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector.
- `scripts/art/analyzeTilesetSeams.js` & `package.json` (`art:analyze-tileset`) – Tileset seam/collision analyzer CLI.
- `reports/art/neon-district-tileset-analysis.json` – Coverage metrics + 108 seam warnings for Neon District atlas.
- `scripts/benchmarks/runLayoutGraphBenchmark.js` & `package.json` (`benchmark:layout-graph`) – LayoutGraph benchmark harness.
- `reports/perf/layout-graph-benchmark-2025-10-31.json` – Benchmark results (mean ≤0.43 ms, worst-case 1.35 ms).
- `benchmark-results/m1-profile-1761951451560.json` – Investigation profiling snapshot from `npm run profile -- --scenario=investigation`.
- Documentation updates: `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`.

## Verification
- `node scripts/art/queueGenerationRequests.js --filter=image-ar-005-tileset-corporate-spires,image-ar-005-tileset-archive-undercity,image-ar-005-tileset-zenith-sector`
- `npm run art:analyze-tileset -- --image=assets/generated/images/ar-005/image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district.png --id=image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district --out=reports/art/neon-district-tileset-analysis.json`
- `npm run benchmark:layout-graph -- --iterations=8 --out=reports/perf/layout-graph-benchmark-2025-10-31.json`
- `npm run profile -- --scenario=investigation`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Monitor GPT completions for the queued AR-005 tilesets and rerun the manifest sync (without `--dry-run`) so statuses flip to `ai-generated` once outputs land.
2. Triage the 108 seam/collision warnings in `reports/art/neon-district-tileset-analysis.json`, promoting confirmed seams into manifest metadata ahead of Neon District integration checks.
3. Wire benchmark/profile outputs into automated alerting and investigate any emergent LayoutGraph or investigation hot spots surfaced by the latest runs.
4. Execute the planned 2025-11-07 AR-050 bespoke sweep (`npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2` → `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) and archive the tolerance report/approvals.

## Backlog & Coordination
- `AR-005: District Tilesets` – Added queue + seam analysis completed work; refreshed next steps to monitor GPT fulfillment and convert seam warnings into metadata.
- `M2-020: Performance & Bug Fix Pass` – Logged new benchmark/profiling automation and shifted next steps toward alerting + hotspot triage.
- WIP remains within limits (AR-050, AR-005, M2-020). Documentation and MCP backlog stay aligned with the new automation deliverables.
