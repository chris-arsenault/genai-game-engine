# Autonomous Development Session #239 – Investigative Loop Automation
**Date**: 2025-11-24  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~70m  
**Focus**: Automate the tutorial investigative loop, refresh art pipeline outputs, and reconfirm save/load telemetry parity via scripted sweeps.

## Summary
- Extended the tutorial quest wiring so the arrival trigger and witness interview advance Act 1 objectives, adjusted QuestManager matching to accept multiple identifiers, and captured a dedicated Playwright spec that drives the minimal investigative loop end-to-end.
- Re-ran the AR-050 lighting automation bundle (track bespoke, package RenderOps, export luminance) producing a fresh packet, approval job, and luminance snapshot with all segments in tolerance.
- Regenerated autosave telemetry dashboards, verified outbox acknowledgements, and confirmed telemetry parity remains at 100% coverage for the save/load instrumentation.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js`, `src/game/scenes/TutorialScene.js`, `src/game/data/quests/act1Quests.js` — Tutorial arrival trigger registration, Quest identifier matching enhancements, and witness-trigger alignment.
- `tests/e2e/tutorial-investigative-loop.spec.js`, `tests/e2e/utils/tutorialActions.js`, updated `tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` — Shared tutorial automation helpers plus a new Playwright investigative-loop scenario; existing overlay suite now consumes shared helpers.
- `reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T20-13-32-755Z` (ZIP, delivery manifest), `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/.../2025-11-01T20:13:32.777Z-9d5eefce-d467-4f54-92c5-37f235d68c5c.json`, `reports/art/luminance-snapshots/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-luminance-2025-11-01T20-13-40-229Z.{json,md}`, and refreshed `reports/art/week1-bespoke-progress.json` from the art automation sweep.
- Autosave telemetry artifacts refreshed: `reports/telemetry/autosave-burst/dashboard-feed.json` mirrors, parity logs, and acknowledgement confirmations.
- Documentation updates: `docs/plans/backlog.md` Session #239 notes and `CHANGELOG.md` entries for the new automation/tutelage path.

## Verification
- `npm test`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-investigative-loop.spec.js`
- `npm run art:track-bespoke`
- `npm run art:package-renderops`
- `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`
- `npm run telemetry:autosave-dashboard`
- `npm run telemetry:ack`
- `npm run telemetry:check-parity`

## Backlog Updates
- `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton` — Arrival trigger and witness interview now progress Act 1 objectives; new Playwright automation in place (`tests/e2e/tutorial-investigative-loop.spec.js`). Future work: extend coverage to deduction board and Captain Reese once UI hooks land.
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` — Week-one bespoke stats refreshed; packet `act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T20-13-32-755Z` staged with zero actionable segments and luminance snapshot timestamped 20-13-40-229Z. Approval job awaiting acknowledgement.
- `M3-016: Save/Load System Implementation` — Autosave dashboard mirrors regenerated, outbox acknowledgements confirmed, parity check at 100%.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Extend the investigative loop Playwright spec to cover deduction board validation and Captain Reese reporting once those hooks land; rerun the loop automation alongside the tutorial overlay smoke in nightly suites.
- Monitor RenderOps approval `2025-11-01T20:13:32.777Z-9d5eefce-d467-4f54-92c5-37f235d68c5c`; stage delivery via `npm run art:stage-renderops -- --packet-dir reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T20-13-32-755Z` when acknowledged and repeat the automation trio at the next cadence checkpoint.
- Schedule the next save/load telemetry acknowledgement sweep after the 2025-11-07 export window; distribute new payloads with `npm run telemetry:distribute-save-load` if additional labels appear.
