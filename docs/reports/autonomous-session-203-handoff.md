# Autonomous Development Session #203 – Neon District Seam Data Integration

**Date**: 2025-11-06  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~75m  
**Focus**: Surface Neon District seam preview clusters inside template manifests, DistrictGenerator placements, and corridor tooling so atlas doorway spans are available to runtime preview pipelines.

## Summary
- Published the frozen `neonDistrictSeamPreview` catalog so tooling can load top doorway clusters without reparsing the preview JSON.
- Extended authored template metadata, TemplateVariantResolver, and DistrictGenerator placements to propagate seam preview metadata and cluster arrays.
- Upgraded CorridorSeamPainter to record seam cluster statistics alongside applied seam tiles, enabling upcoming preview dashboards to reason about doorway spans.
- Refreshed procedural infrastructure tests (resolver, seam painter, generator) and added a catalog unit test to lock the new data contract.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/procedural/templates/neonDistrictSeamPreview.js`
- `src/game/procedural/templates/authoredTemplates.js` (tileset metadata helper + manifest wiring)
- `src/game/procedural/TemplateVariantResolver.js`
- `src/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.js`
- `src/game/procedural/CorridorSeamPainter.js`
- `tests/game/procedural/templates/neonDistrictSeamPreview.test.js`
- `tests/game/procedural/TilemapInfrastructure.test.js`
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-005: District Tilesets (M4)** – Logged the seam preview catalog integration, updated completed work, and refreshed next steps to focus on the remaining atlases and the forthcoming preview UI hook-up.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Added Session 203 entry describing the seam preview catalog and runtime wiring.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Reflected the new Neon District integration status and updated follow-up bullets.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Run the analyze -> promote -> preview -> validate pipeline for Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector once their reports land so each atlas ships with seam manifests and preview summaries.
- Surface the shared seam preview catalog inside the runtime tileset preview UI when that layer ships, and replicate the manifest/catalog wiring for the remaining atlases after their seam manifests are promoted.

## Verification
- `npm test`

## Metrics
- Neon District seam catalog exposes 8 doorway clusters (longest span 19 tiles) covering 108 annotations with orientation distribution vertical 50 / horizontal 58 and open-edge distribution east 45 / south 31 / north 19 / west 13. CorridorSeamPainter now reports cluster counts and orientation buckets per placement pass.
