# Autonomous Development Session #119 – ECS Core Enhancements

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h 30m  
**Focus**: Harden ECS lifecycle + spatial hashing to meet backlog acceptance criteria.

---

## Summary
- Enhanced `EntityManager` with pooled metadata, destroy listeners, component query bridging, and profiling helpers (`getStats`, `forEachEntity`) per plan in `docs/plans/ecs-core-enhancement-plan.md`.
- Upgraded `SpatialHash` to track per-entity cell occupancy, add `update`/`remove`/`rebuild`, and expose instrumentation via `getMetrics`, eliminating phantom collisions under movement.
- Augmented `ComponentRegistry` to auto-bind the manager, safely clear component signatures, and surface `getComponentsForEntity`/`getComponentSignature` for tooling.
- Authored `docs/tech/ecs.md` summarizing new APIs, profiling workflows, and narrative hooks; synced backlog entries `M1-002` and `M1-012` to **in-review** with updated notes.

---

## Deliverables
- **Engine**  
  - `src/engine/ecs/EntityManager.js`: Pool + lifecycle hooks, component queries, destroy events, stats (`createEntity`, `destroyEntity`, `queryByComponents`, `getStats`).  
  - `src/engine/ecs/ComponentRegistry.js`: Manager auto-binding, safe clear, entity component accessors (`getComponentsForEntity`, `getComponentSignature`).  
  - `src/engine/physics/SpatialHash.js`: Insert/update/remove diffing, rebuild pipeline, metrics reporting.
- **Tests**  
  - `tests/engine/ecs/EntityManager.test.js`: Expanded coverage for pooling, registry integration, query delegation, and 10k performance gates.  
  - `tests/engine/ecs/ComponentRegistry.test.js`: Coverage for new entity component accessors and clear semantics.  
  - `tests/engine/physics/SpatialHash.test.js`: Update/remove/rebuild/metrics cases with tightened performance assertions.
- **Planning & Docs**  
  - `docs/plans/ecs-core-enhancement-plan.md`: Implementation roadmap for ECS lifecycle + spatial hash upgrades.  
  - `docs/tech/ecs.md`: Technical guide documenting APIs, usage patterns, and profiling hooks.  
  - `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Marked `M1-002` and `M1-012` as completed (Session #119) with session notes.
- **Architecture**  
  - MCP decision `ECS Core Enhancement (EntityManager + SpatialHash)` recorded to track rationale and alternatives.

## Verification
- `npm test` (full Jest suite) – PASS @ 2025-11-13 05:10 UTC (~27.9s)

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Share the staged RenderOps bundle (`deliveries/renderops/act2-crossroads/...`) with RenderOps, capture feedback, regenerate if lighting tweaks requested.
2. Kick off Week 1 of the placeholder replacement schedule (AR-001–AR-005) and update `assets/images/requests.json` plus schedule docs as bespoke assets are approved.
3. Circulate the telemetry reminder bundle (`deliveries/telemetry/act2-crossroads-20251112/...`), confirm `.ics` import with analytics, and adjust `--warning-days` if earlier alerts are needed.
4. Wire `EntityManager` destroy listeners into `QuestManager`/`FactionManager` to immediately reflect despawns in narrative state (see backlog `M1-002` next steps).
5. Surface `SpatialHash.getMetrics()` in debug overlays to monitor bucket load during stealth scenes (backlog `M1-012` next steps).

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `M1-002` and `M1-012` moved to **in-review** with completed work + next steps captured in MCP and `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- New technical reference: `docs/tech/ecs.md` for ECS lifecycle usage, profiling, and narrative hooks.
- Plan reference: `docs/plans/ecs-core-enhancement-plan.md` for phased rollout; architecture decision stored in MCP.

---

## Notes
- `EntityManager.getStats()` + `SpatialHash.getMetrics()` provide lightweight instrumentation; integrate into debug HUD when analytics team requests live telemetry.
- Pool reuse thresholds tested with 10k churn; ensure CI variance stays below ~200 ms threshold—tunable via test constants if hardware changes.
