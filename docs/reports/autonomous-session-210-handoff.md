# Autonomous Development Session #210 – Zenith Infiltration Bridge

**Date**: 2025-11-17  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~95m  
**Focus**: Stand up the Act 3 Zenith infiltration quest, wire stance-aware triggers, and extend automated coverage/documentation.

## Summary
- Authored `main-act3-zenith-infiltration` with shared/stance stage objectives, updated QuestManager stage handling, and registered the quest at runtime so Act 3 progression chains continue after Gathering Support.
- Seeded Zenith Sector trigger layouts and metadata to emit `act3:zenith_infiltration:stage` payloads with stance, branch, and telemetry context for downstream systems and analytics.
- Expanded Jest coverage to validate new stage events and trigger emission, refreshed narrative/backlog docs to catalogue objective IDs and success flags, and updated MCP backlog state.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`: Added the `zenithInfiltration` configuration with shared stages, stance routing, success flags, and rewards (`lines 485-652`).
- `src/game/data/quests/act3ZenithInfiltrationQuest.js`: Quest builder/registration helpers that translate config stages into objectives, branches, and metadata (`lines 1-258`).
- `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js`: Subscribed to `act3:zenith_infiltration:stage` and persisted stage telemetry/story flags (`lines 63-65`, `902-940`).
- `src/game/systems/QuestSystem.js`: Emitted staged narrative events when trigger metadata defines `emitEvent`, preserving telemetry context (`lines 320-365`).
- `src/game/scenes/Act3ZenithInfiltrationScene.js`: Zenith trigger layout/registration ensuring QuestTriggerRegistry is seeded and runtime loaders spawn staged triggers (`lines 1-322`).
- `src/game/Game.js`: Registered the new quest during initialization so save pipelines and runtime sessions pick it up (`lines 84-402`).
- Tests: `tests/game/managers/QuestManager.act3.test.js` and `tests/game/systems/QuestSystem.trigger.test.js` now assert shared/branch stage behaviour (`lines 103-167`, `116-155`).
- Documentation: `docs/narrative/quests/act-3-quests.md` and `docs/plans/backlog.md` updated with objective/success-flag matrices and backlog status.

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`) — Logged the Zenith infiltration quest/trigger implementation, recorded automated coverage, and refreshed next steps toward finale cinematics and dialogue authoring.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/narrative/quests/act-3-quests.md` — Added implementation notes for shared and stance-specific infiltration objectives plus telemetry flag mappings.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Documented Session 210 progress under Act 3 Narrative with pointers to quest/config/test changes and upcoming tasks.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Integrate finale cinematics with the Act 3 epilogue exporter outputs and gate playback on infiltration completion flags.
- Author stance-specific infiltration dialogue beats and prompts once the scene layouts are finalized.
- Schedule Playwright coverage for the Zenith infiltration route when geometry stabilizes to validate trigger sequencing end-to-end.

## Verification
- `npm test` (full suite, 214 suites / 2504 tests passing).

## Metrics
- Content: 1 new Act 3 quest definition, 12 staged trigger layouts, 9 success flags driving infiltration progression.
- Automation: 2 new Jest suites guarding QuestManager stage routing and QuestSystem metadata emission; QuestTriggerRegistry now seeds 12 Zenith definitions.
