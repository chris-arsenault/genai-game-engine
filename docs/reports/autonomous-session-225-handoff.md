# Autonomous Development Session #225 – Act 3 Finale Save/Load Continuity

**Date**: 2025-11-02  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~65m  
**Focus**: Persist the Act 3 finale cinematic state across save/load and prove stance-specific artwork survives automated hydration.

## MCP Status
- `game-mcp-server` responded normally; imported the Session 224 handoff, refreshed the backlog, and recorded new progress against **Act 3 Narrative**.

## Summary
- Extended `SaveManager` to serialize the finale cinematic snapshot (including stance hero/beat descriptors) and hydrate it on load, emitting a `narrative:finale_cinematic_restored` hook for downstream systems.
- Added a dedicated `Act3FinaleCinematicController.hydrate` flow so overlays reconstruct visuals/progress from saved payloads using runtime asset descriptors.
- Expanded Jest coverage to guard finale save/load continuity and controller hydration, then mirrored the updates into `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js` — finale cinematic persistence pipeline plus restore wiring.
- `src/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.js` — state tracking upgrades and hydration support.
- `src/game/Game.js` — SaveManager/controller linkage for finale persistence.
- `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`, `tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js` — save/load continuity and hydration coverage.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Session 225 backlog notes and next steps.

## Commands Executed
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`): Logged Session 225 finale persistence work, removed the save/load follow-up, and left the adaptive audio re-validation as the remaining action.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Re-run the finale cinematic E2E once the adaptive audio mix lands to validate mood transitions and telemetry hand-offs.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js` — both suites passed, confirming finale hydration and SaveManager persistence.

## Metrics
- Jest targeted suites: 2/2 passed in 1.5 s; finale hydration assertions validated hero/beat descriptors and restore event emission.
