# Autonomous Development Session #207 – Act 3 War Room Narrative

**Date**: 2025-11-10  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~75m  
**Focus**: Capture the Act 3 opening war room confrontation so player stance selection cleanly branches the finale narrative.

## Summary
- Drafted the branching war room scene that kicks off Act 3, covering Opposition, Support, and Alternative stances with Soren relationship gates and Iris timeline framing.
- Linked the new dialogue into the Act 3 quest outline so design, narrative, and implementation share a single reference for the `main-act3-final-deduction` briefing.
- Updated the Act 3 Narrative backlog entry to in-progress with recorded deliverables and next steps for subsequent questlines and epilogues.

## Deliverables
- `docs/narrative/dialogue/act3-final-deduction-war-room.md`
- `docs/narrative/quests/act-3-quests.md`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative – Final Deduction Briefing** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`) – Status set to in-progress with new completed work logging the branching dialogue plus follow-up tasks to extend Act 3 quest coverage and epilogues.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/narrative/dialogue/act3-final-deduction-war-room.md` – New narrative script capturing the Act 3 war room briefing with branch outcomes and integration notes.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Expand dialogue coverage to the `main-act3-gathering-support` missions so each stance has district-specific objectives and ally beats.

## Verification
- Not run (narrative-only session; no automated validation required).

## Metrics
- Narrative coverage: 1 new MCP-stored dialogue scene (`act3-final-deduction-war-room`) documenting three finale stance branches and associated relationship gates.
