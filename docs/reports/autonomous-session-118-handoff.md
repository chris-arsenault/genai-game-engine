# Autonomous Development Session #118 – Bespoke Art Sprint Scheduling & Delivery Staging

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h  
**Status**: Placeholder replacements now follow a four-week sprint schedule, RenderOps packets stage into share-ready delivery folders, and telemetry reminders ship with bundled JSON/Markdown/ICS handoffs.

---

## Summary
- Authored `PlaceholderSchedulePlanner` with a CLI (`scripts/art/planPlaceholderReplacements.js`) that converts the AR-001 – AR-005 replacement plan into a dated four-week schedule (`reports/art/placeholder-replacement-schedule.(json|md)`) and refreshed docs/backlog to anchor assignments.
- Added `scripts/art/stageRenderOpsDelivery.js` + npm alias `art:stage-renderops` to mirror generated packets into `deliveries/renderops/<label>/<timestamp>/` alongside staging manifests and handoff notes; staged the latest Act 2 Crossroads bundle.
- Introduced `scripts/telemetry/stageParityReminder.js` + npm alias `telemetry:stage-reminder` to package reminder JSON/Markdown/ICS into `deliveries/telemetry/<dispatch-label>/...`, updating telemetry docs/backlog to drive distribution discipline.

---

## Deliverables
- **Engine/Tooling**: New `src/game/tools/PlaceholderSchedulePlanner.js`, CLI scripts `scripts/art/planPlaceholderReplacements.js`, `scripts/art/stageRenderOpsDelivery.js`, `scripts/telemetry/stageParityReminder.js`, and Jest coverage via `tests/game/tools/PlaceholderSchedulePlanner.test.js`; tests updated for Act2Crossroads validator and BSP generator thresholds.
- **Reports & Artifacts**: Generated `reports/art/placeholder-replacement-plan.(json|md)` and `reports/art/placeholder-replacement-schedule.(json|md)`, refreshed placeholder audit outputs, produced a share-ready packet directory (`reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-10-30T11-45-11-255Z/*` + ZIP + delivery manifest), staged assets in `deliveries/renderops/act2-crossroads/...`, and created telemetry reminder bundles (`reports/telemetry/parity-schedule-reminder.json|md|ics`, `deliveries/telemetry/act2-crossroads-20251112/...`).
- **Docs & Backlog**: Updated `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/guides/telemetry-parity-dispatch.md`, and `docs/plans/backlog.md` with new tooling and schedules; backlog items `AR-050` and `TEL-021` amended with Session #118 work and follow-ups; `package.json` now exposes `art:plan-placeholder-schedule`, `art:stage-renderops`, and `telemetry:stage-reminder`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test` (jest – full suite)

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Deliver the staged RenderOps bundle (`deliveries/renderops/act2-crossroads/…`) to the RenderOps team, collect feedback on actionable segments, and regenerate packets if lighting tweaks are requested.
2. Kick off Week 1 of the placeholder replacement schedule (five assets) and update `assets/images/requests.json` + schedule docs as bespoke pieces are approved.
3. Circulate the telemetry reminder staging folder (`deliveries/telemetry/act2-crossroads-20251112/...`), confirm the `.ics` import with analytics, and adjust `--warning-days` when earlier alerts are needed.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `AR-050` now records the bespoke sprint schedule tooling (`planPlaceholderReplacements`, staged deliveries) with next steps pointing to the weekly cadence and staged packet sharing.
- `TEL-021` captures the reminder staging automation and instructs teams to run both `telemetry:reminder` and `telemetry:stage-reminder` before each cadence checkpoint.
- Docs refreshed to cover new commands and schedules (`docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/guides/telemetry-parity-dispatch.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`).

---

## Notes
- `npm run art:stage-renderops` copies the latest packet ZIP, delivery manifest, and share manifest into a dedicated delivery folder with a generated `handoff-readme.md` for outbound communication.
- Placeholder schedule defaults to five assets per week starting 2025-11-03; rerun `npm run art:plan-placeholder-schedule -- --start-date=<ISO> --slots-per-week=<n>` to shift cadence.
- `npm run telemetry:stage-reminder` keeps analytics notified via ready-to-share JSON/Markdown/ICS; review `staging-manifest.json` to confirm acknowledgement tracking.
