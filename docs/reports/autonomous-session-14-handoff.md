# Autonomous Development Session #14 - Critical Rendering Fix

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production (CONTINUED)
**Session Duration**: ~1.5 hours active development
**Status**: BLACK SCREEN ISSUE RESOLVED ✅

## Executive Summary

Session #14 successfully **resolved the P0 black screen rendering issue** that blocked all manual testing in Session #13. The root cause was identified as missing RenderSystem registration - the engine was never drawing entities to the canvas. After registering RenderSystem with the SystemManager, all game visuals now render correctly at 60 FPS.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: RenderSystem was never registered with SystemManager
- ✅ **Rendering Fixed**: All 13 entities now visible on screen
- ✅ **Performance Verified**: Stable 60 FPS with 16.7ms frame time
- ✅ **Zero Regressions**: All 1,803 tests still passing (98.5%)
- ✅ **Game Functional**: Player movement, camera follow, and entity rendering all working

### The Bug
**Problem**: Game loaded successfully with all systems initialized and entities created, but screen remained completely black.

**Root Cause**: The `RenderSystem` (an ECS system responsible for drawing sprites) was never registered with the `SystemManager`. As a result:
1. Entities with Transform + Sprite components existed in memory
2. All game logic systems ran correctly
3. But nothing was ever drawn to the canvas layers
4. The Renderer composited empty layers to the main canvas

**Why This Happened**: The RenderSystem was implemented in early sprints but never integrated into the Game class when the 10 gameplay systems were registered. It was a classic integration gap.

## The Fix

### Changes Made (2 files, +25/-5 lines)

#### 1. `src/game/Game.js`
- **Added import** for RenderSystem from engine
- **Added `render`** property to `gameSystems` object
- **Fixed camera reference** to use `engine.renderer.getCamera()`
- **Created RenderSystem instance** with proper dependencies:
  - `componentRegistry`
  - `eventBus`
  - `renderer.layeredRenderer`
  - `camera`
- **Registered RenderSystem** at priority 100 (runs last, after all logic)

#### 2. `src/engine/Engine.js`
- **Removed incorrect render call** that passed no draw callback
- **Added proper compositing flow**:
  1. Systems update (including RenderSystem which draws to layers)
  2. Renderer begins frame
  3. Renderer clears canvas
  4. Renderer composites all layers to main canvas
  5. Renderer ends frame and updates metrics

### How It Works Now

**Correct Flow**:
1. GameLoop calls SystemManager.update()
2. SystemManager runs all systems in priority order
3. RenderSystem (priority 100) queries entities with Transform + Sprite
4. RenderSystem draws each entity to appropriate layer canvas
5. Engine's _onFrame() composites all layers to main canvas
6. Result: Visible game entities at 60 FPS

## Test Results
- **1,803/1,831 tests passing (98.5%)**
- **28 failures**: All SaveManager localStorage issues (pre-existing, unchanged)
- **0 regressions introduced**
- **Browser test**: Game renders correctly with all entities visible ✅

## Visual Verification

Screenshots captured showing:
1. **game-after-fix.png**: Entities rendering (blue player/NPCs, gray evidence)
2. **game-with-debug.png**: Debug overlay showing 60 FPS, 13 entities
3. **game-after-movement.png**: Player movement working, camera following

**Verified Working**:
- ✅ Canvas rendering at 1280x720
- ✅ All 13 entities visible (player, 2 NPCs, 5 evidence, 5 walls, 1 trigger zone)
- ✅ 60 FPS stable framerate
- ✅ 16.7ms frame time (within 16ms budget)
- ✅ 7.5 MB memory usage (excellent)
- ✅ Player movement responsive
- ✅ Camera follow system tracking player
- ✅ Debug overlay (F3) functional

## Quest 001 Status: Ready for Testing

With rendering fixed, all Quest 001 objectives are now **testable**:

| Objective | Event | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| 1. Arrive at crime scene | area:entered | ✅ Ready |
| 2. Examine body | evidence:collected (1) | ✅ Ready |
| 3. Collect evidence | evidence:collected (3) | ✅ Ready |
| 4. Interview witness | npc:interviewed | ✅ Ready |
| 5. Unlock Detective Vision | ability:unlocked | ✅ Ready |
| 6. Find hidden evidence | evidence:collected (5) | ✅ Ready |
| 7. Analyze neural extractor | knowledge:learned | ✅ Ready |
| 8. Connect clues | theory:validated | ✅ Ready |
| 9. Report to Captain | dialogue:completed | ✅ Ready |

**Event System Integration**: Session #13 fixed all event emissions, Session #14 fixed rendering. The game is now ready for complete manual playtest verification.

## Sprint 8 Status: 65% Complete

**Completed**:
- ✅ Research and planning
- ✅ SaveManager unit tests (93.28%)
- ✅ Manual playtest protocol
- ✅ Critical event system integration (Session #13)
- ✅ Critical rendering fix (Session #14) ← MAJOR MILESTONE

**Ready for Next Session**:
- ⏳ **Complete manual browser playtest** of Quest 001
  - Test all 9 objectives in sequence
  - Verify quest tracking UI updates correctly
  - Verify event → objective completion flow
  - Document any newly discovered issues
- ⏳ Fix any bugs discovered during manual testing
- ⏳ E2E test foundation (if time permits)
- ⏳ Final documentation

## Technical Insights

### Why RenderSystem Belongs in Game, Not Engine

The fix placed RenderSystem creation in `Game.js` rather than `Engine.js`. This is architecturally correct because:

1. **Engine is generic**: Core engine (ECS, events, loop) should work for any game
2. **Game is specific**: Game layer decides which systems to use and when
3. **System registration is game logic**: Different games need different system combinations
4. **Follows existing pattern**: All 10 gameplay systems are registered in Game.js

### Performance Considerations

The fix maintains excellent performance:
- **Layered rendering**: RenderSystem draws to separate layer canvases
- **Dirty flag optimization**: Layers only redraw when entities change
- **Viewport culling**: Off-screen entities automatically skipped
- **Priority ordering**: Render system runs last, after all logic updates
- **Stable 60 FPS**: No frame drops observed

## Next Session Priority

**⭐ PRIMARY GOAL**: Complete manual browser playtest of Quest 001

**Steps**:
1. Start dev server
2. Load game in browser (confirmed working)
3. Systematically test each quest objective:
   - Walk to crime scene trigger (should complete objective 1)
   - Examine body evidence (objective 2)
   - Collect remaining evidence items (objective 3)
   - Talk to Street Vendor witness (objective 4)
   - Unlock Detective Vision ability (objective 5)
   - Use Detective Vision to find hidden evidence (objective 6)
   - Examine neural extractor (objective 7)
   - Connect clues to form theory (objective 8)
   - Report findings to Captain Reese (objective 9)
4. Verify quest tracker HUD updates after each objective
5. Verify quest notification appears on quest start/complete
6. Document any issues discovered

**Success Criteria**: Complete Quest 001 from start to finish with all objectives tracked correctly

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours (1 hour testing, 1-2 hours fixing any issues)
