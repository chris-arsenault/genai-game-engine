# Autonomous Development Session #144 – Particle Runtime & FX HUD Integration

**Date**: November 10, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 25m  
**Focus**: Land the particle emitter runtime for composite cues, surface FX coordinator telemetry in the developer HUD, and align Dialogue/Inventory overlays with the expanded FX cue catalog.

---

## Summary
- Delivered `ParticleEmitterRuntime` with pooled emitters/particles, wiring it into the `Game` lifecycle so `fx:particle_emit` descriptors now drive on-canvas treatments without duplicating coordinator logic.
- Integrated `fx:metrics_sample` / `fx:metrics_warning` into the developer HUD, adding an FX metrics panel that tracks live/average/peak throughput and flagging warnings inside the debug overlay.
- Instrumented DialogueBox and Inventory overlays with reveal/dismiss/focus cues, updating FX coordination/overlay/particle mappings to honour the new identifiers and keeping coverage tight across UI suites.

## Verification
- `npm test`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Stress-test the particle emitter runtime with higher-intensity presets once bespoke particle sheets arrive, tuning `maxEmitters` / pool sizes as needed for 60 FPS headroom.
2. Run a manual HUD pass (or add Playwright coverage) to confirm the new FX metrics panel scales cleanly across debug overlay resolutions and preserves keyboard focus behaviour.
3. Audit remaining overlays (e.g., SaveInspector, ControlBindings) for optional FX cue hooks to keep HUD signalling consistent once those surfaces receive polish.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Closed MCP backlog items `FX-240`, `DEBUG-275`, and `FX-241`; recorded completed work, validation commands, and cleared next steps.
- Updated `docs/plans/backlog.md` with a Session #144 section summarising the particle runtime, FX HUD integration, and dialogue/inventory cue work.

---

## Notes
- FX metrics HUD bindings maintain paused/live sample snapshots; warnings auto-clear after the six-second cooldown but can be extended once profiler tooling lands.
- `InvestigationSystem.scanForEvidence` now accepts prior two-argument invocations (player transform + entities), preserving TutorialScene expectations after signature cleanup.
