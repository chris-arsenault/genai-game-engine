# Autonomous Development Session #115 – Crossroads Asset Placeholders & Telemetry Sweep

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h10m  
**Status**: Placeholder atlases in place, RenderOps lighting packet prepared, telemetry cadence reset for next analytics pull.

---

## Summary
- Generated neon-noir placeholder atlases for every AR-001 through AR-005 request via `scripts/art/generate_ar_placeholders.py`, unblocking UI/investigation iteration while bespoke art is sourced.
- Refreshed the Crossroads lighting preview (`reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json`) and authored an accompanying RenderOps-facing summary (`reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview-summary.md`) covering all 11 segments.
- Re-ran quest telemetry parity against the latest sample, recorded the manual acknowledgement in `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/parity-schedule.json`, and pushed the next cadence checkpoint to 2025-11-27.

---

## Deliverables
- Placeholder assets: `assets/generated/ar-placeholders/*.png` (16 atlases covering deduction board UI, evidence icons, player/NPC sprites, and four district tilesets).
- Manifest updates: `assets/images/requests.json` entries for AR-001–AR-005 now `placeholder-generated` with provenance timestamps and internal licensing notes.
- Documentation: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` (Session 115 section + revised next actions) and `docs/plans/backlog.md` (table + next-session focus updates).
- Lighting packet: Regenerated preview JSON plus new share-out markdown at `reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview-summary.md`.
- Telemetry cadence: `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/parity-schedule.json` annotated with Session 115 acknowledgement, history entry, and updated `nextCheckAt`.

---

## Verification
- `python scripts/art/generate_ar_placeholders.py`
- `node scripts/art/previewCrossroadsLighting.js --out=reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json`
- `python - <<'PY' ...` (renders `reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview-summary.md` from the JSON report)
- `node scripts/telemetry/checkQuestTelemetryParity.js --samples=telemetry-artifacts/samples/quest-telemetry-act2-crossroads-2025-11-12.jsonl --summary-out telemetry-artifacts/reports/act2-crossroads-parity-summary.json`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **RenderOps validation** – Distribute the lighting summary to RenderOps and capture any requested adjustments or follow-up captures.
2. **Bespoke asset sourcing** – Replace Session 115 placeholders with final art (AI or commissioned) before content lock; update manifests with definitive licensing once approved.
3. **Telemetry cadence** – Monitor `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/parity-schedule.json` for the 2025-11-27 check; prepare fresh samples if analytics requests expanded coverage.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` – Added Session 115 placeholder work to `completed_work`, refreshed `next_steps` to focus on RenderOps share-out and placeholder review.
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Logged placeholder generation details and revised next actions to emphasise bespoke replacements.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – High-priority table and next-session focus now reference the placeholder set and the updated telemetry cadence.

---

## Notes
- Placeholder assets are strictly interim; they cover gameplay layout needs but lack the fidelity required for ship. Flag any UI readability issues while playtesting the new atlases.
- The lighting summary surfaces full luminance deltas so RenderOps can sign off asynchronously; re-run the preview script after any art tweaks to keep numbers aligned.
- Telemetry history logging now captures Session 115 verification; continue using the schedule file as the single source for parity commitments.
