# Autonomous Development Session #196 – LayoutGraph Performance Guardrail

**Date**: 2025-11-03  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~65m  
**Focus**: Stabilize LayoutGraph performance regression coverage to keep M2 verification green.

## Summary
- Reworked `LayoutGraph` performance regression to sample multiple runs and enforce realistic timing thresholds tied to our 16 ms frame budget.
- Confirmed the updated guardrail keeps end-to-end graph construction/pathfinding expectations intact while eliminating the prior <1 ms flake.
- Synced MCP backlog + markdown for `M2-020` with the new coverage work and recorded remaining performance follow-ups.

## Deliverables
- `tests/engine/procedural/LayoutGraph.test.js` (multi-iteration benchmark, average/worst-case assertions, frame-budget commentary)
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session 196 status + latest update for `M2-020`)
- MCP backlog item `M2-020` marked in-progress with completed work + refreshed next steps

## Verification
- `npm test -- LayoutGraph` → ✅ passes
- `npm test` → Jest reported 205/205 suites passing; harness aborted at ~13.3 s timeout after success (no failing suites)

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Profile `LayoutGraph` against larger node counts and audit for additional unrealistic timing asserts (tracked under `M2-020` next steps).
2. **AR-050** – Monitor RenderOps feedback ahead of the 2025-11-07 bespoke sweep (`npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2`).
3. **M3-016 Telemetry checks** – Re-run telemetry outbox/ack audits during the 2025-11-07 automation window.
4. **UX-410** – Execute `node scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.js --label autosave-20251107` on 2025-11-07 and archive findings.

## Backlog & Coordination
- `M2-020: M2 Performance and Bug Fix Pass` is **in progress** with Session 196 completed work recorded (LayoutGraph performance guardrail) and updated next steps (broader profiling + timing assert sweep). Markdown backlog mirrors MCP.
- WIP tally remains within the cap: AR-050 (in-progress), M2-020 (in-progress), M2-006 (ready-for-review). No new items opened.
- Next session can expand profiling coverage for LayoutGraph or pivot to shepherding M2-006 through review once bandwidth allows.
