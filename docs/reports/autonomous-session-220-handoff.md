# Autonomous Development Session #220 – Memory Parlor Overlay Integration

**Date**: 2025-11-19  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Wire the Memory Parlor neon overlay into the infiltration composite, validate automation outputs, and refresh asset/backlog records.

## Summary
- Updated `loadMemoryParlorScene` to preload `memory_parlor_neon_001.png` through the runtime asset loader with a tinted fallback path and surfaced overlay metadata for downstream tooling.
- Passed the engine asset loader into Memory Parlor scene loads and added Jest coverage that exercises both the loader-backed and fallback overlay paths.
- Re-ran the luminance export after integration, confirming the Crossroads overlay suite remains within tolerance while documenting the new automation snapshot.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js` — overlay descriptor, loader-driven sprite creation, metadata capture, and fallback tint handling.
- `src/game/Game.js` — propagates the engine asset loader into Memory Parlor scene loads so the overlay can hydrate in runtime builds.
- `tests/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.overlay.test.js` — verifies overlay hydration when a loader is provided and the tinted fallback when it is absent.
- `reports/art/luminance-snapshots/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-luminance-2025-11-01T04-56-28-934Z.{json,md}` — post-integration luminance snapshot (12/12 segments passing).
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md` — logged the runtime integration, new automation snapshot, and refreshed AR-050 priorities.

## Commands Executed
- `npm test -- MemoryParlorScene`
- `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** (`3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`): recorded Session 220 overlay integration and luminance export in `completed_work`, refreshed the notes, and shifted `next_steps` toward a Memory Parlor–specific luminance snapshot plus manifest promotion.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Add Memory Parlor infiltration segments to the automated luminance export and promote the composite metadata into the shared scene-art manifests.
- Execute the full art automation regression bundle once the Memory Parlor snapshot is live to keep tolerance reports current.

## Verification
- Targeted Jest suite (`npm test -- MemoryParlorScene`)
- Luminance snapshot export (`npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`)

## Metrics
- Act 2 Crossroads luminance sweep: 12/12 segments remain within tolerance after the overlay integration (`reports/art/luminance-snapshots/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-luminance-2025-11-01T04-56-28-934Z.md`).
