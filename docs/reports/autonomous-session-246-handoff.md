# Autonomous Development Session #246 – Camera Bounds Enforcement
**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~55m  
**Focus**: Close M1-008 by enforcing camera world bounds and expanding automated coverage.

## Summary
- Added world-bounds support to the engine camera so follow, manual moves, and zoom adjustments stay inside level limits.
- Expanded Jest coverage to lock in bounds clamping, zoom recentering, and follow behavior alongside existing coordinate conversion tests.
- Synced the backlog entry and documentation to reflect the completed camera work and verification command.

## Deliverables
- `src/engine/renderer/Camera.js`
- `tests/engine/renderer/Camera.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/engine/renderer/Camera.test.js`

## Backlog Updates
- `M1-008: Camera System Implementation` — marked complete after adding world-bounds clamping and reinforcing Jest coverage.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Schedule the expanded CORE-303 investigative loop Playwright spec to run with the tutorial overlay smoke suite in the next nightly (guards upcoming quest log UI work).
- Profile the deduction board overlay responsiveness once the new art assets arrive to ensure drag/drop latency stays under 16 ms (M2-005 follow-up).
- Continue the AR-050 visual pipeline weekly automation sweeps (`npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) and track RenderOps acknowledgements.
- Keep the M3-003 faction ECS scaffolding staged until upstream data contracts finalize, noting dependencies as they appear.
- Integrate the camera bounds into level/scene loading so `setBounds` receives authoritative world dimensions during runtime scene activation.
