**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Validate Act 2 Crossroads lighting metrics and acknowledge the pending RenderOps approval packet within the art automation pipeline.

## Summary
- Reviewed the latest Act 2 Crossroads lighting preview and luminance snapshot, confirming all 12 segments remain within configured tolerances.
- Authored a dedicated lighting QA record to capture the review outcome and reference source datasets for future audits.
- Acknowledged RenderOps approval job `9cc27c03-3b58-4c29-8c71-36dfe28507ae`, updating telemetry, approval summaries, and backlog guidance to reflect the cleared packet.

## Deliverables
- `reports/art/lighting-qa/act2-crossroads-2025-11-22.md` — Logged the 2025-11-22 lighting QA findings with segment-level observations and approval decision.
- `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/act2-crossroads/2025-11-01T09:10:32.110Z-9cc27c03-3b58-4c29-8c71-36dfe28507ae.json` — Marked the packet as completed with acknowledgement metadata and QA reference notes.

- `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/index.json` — Registered the completed status for job `9cc27c03-3b58-4c29-8c71-36dfe28507ae`.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Updated AR-050 guidance to note the acknowledgement and shift the focus to ongoing automation sweeps.

## Verification
- No automated tests executed (documentation and telemetry updates only).

## Backlog Updates
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline (3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555)` — Added Session 237 completed work entry for the lighting QA review and acknowledgement; next steps now emphasize continuing weekly automation sweeps.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` — Maintain weekly art automation sweeps (`npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) to surface any new actionable segments.
- `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton` — Integrate the repaired investigation/dialogue wiring into tutorial quest beats once CORE-301/302 hooks land, then run the investigative loop Playwright validation.
