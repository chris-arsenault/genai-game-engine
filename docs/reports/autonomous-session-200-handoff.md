# Autonomous Development Session #200 – Backlog Performance Freeze Alignment

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Cancel all performance management work and realign backlog/documentation to prevent future performance-task intake.

## Summary
- Cancelled every active performance-oriented backlog item (`M1-022`, `M1-025`, `PERF-118`, `M2-020`, `M3-020`), moving them to `cancelled` status with notes documenting the 2025-11-04 freeze.
- Cleared lingering follow-up actions on completed performance tooling (`FX-236`, `FX-238`, `PERF-214`) so no future monitoring or alerting is scheduled.
- Updated `docs/plans/backlog.md` governance, priority table, and task sections to reflect the freeze, removing calls to trend benchmarks and adding explicit cancellation notes.
- Verified WIP remains within limits after the removals; only non-performance initiatives (e.g., `AR-050` asset automation) stay in progress.

## Backlog Updates
- **M1-022: Asset Priority System** – Status set to `cancelled`; added freeze rationale to notes and backlog doc.
- **M1-025: Engine Performance Profiling** – Status set to `cancelled`; removed pending profiling tasks.
- **PERF-118: LevelSpawnSystem Spawn Loop Baseline** – Status set to `cancelled`; no telemetry baselining to proceed.
- **M2-020: M2 Performance and Bug Fix Pass** – Status set to `cancelled`; benchmark tooling retained only for historical reference.
- **M3-020: M3 Bug Fix and Polish Pass** – Status set to `cancelled`; GC/optimization follow-ups dropped.
- **FX-236 / FX-238** – Cleared `next_steps` and appended maintenance-only notes honoring the freeze.
- Confirmed remaining performance-tagged items are either `done/completed` or `cancelled`; no new performance work queued.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`  
  - Updated governance bullet to the new 2025-11-04 performance freeze directive.  
  - Revised high-priority table to remove profiling follow-ups and inserted freeze reminder in “Next Session Focus.”  
  - Marked sections for `PERF-118`, `M1-022`, `M1-025`, `M2-020`, `M3-020`, `FX-236`, `FX-238`, and `PERF-214` with explicit cancellation/maintenance notes.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Continue non-performance priorities:
  - `AR-050` automation: run the scheduled `art:track-bespoke` / `art:export-crossroads-luminance` sweep on 2025-11-07 and archive outputs.
  - Convert Neon District seam analysis warnings into metadata before enabling tileset previews.
  - Advance narrative deliverables (e.g., Act 3 narrative planning) without introducing performance monitoring.
- Maintain the performance freeze: reject or re-scope any new backlog requests that center on profiling, benchmarking, telemetry, or optimization.

## Verification
- No code execution or automated tests were run (documentation/backlog-only session).

## Metrics
- WIP after cancellations: 1 in-progress item (`AR-050`), all other performance-tagged work closed or complete.
