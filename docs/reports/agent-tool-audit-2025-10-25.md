## Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: Architect Agent Missing Critical Tools ❌

**Agent**: `.claude/agents/architect.md`

**Current Tools**:
- Read
- Glob
- Grep

**Missing Tools**:
- **Write** - Cannot create planning documents
- **Edit** - Cannot update existing documents

**Impact**:
- Cannot create `docs/plans/project-overview.md`
- Cannot create `docs/architecture/systems-map.md`
- Cannot create `docs/architecture/tech-specs.md`
- Blocks entire planning phase

**Fix**: Add Write and Edit to tools list

---

## Settings.local.json Audit

**Current Content**:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "WebSearch",
      "Bash(mkdir:*)"
    ],
    "deny": [],
    "ask": []
  }
}
```

### Missing Permissions

The settings.local.json needs to allow ALL tools that agents use:

**Tools Used Across All Agents**:
1. Read
2. Write
3. Edit
4. Glob
5. Grep
6. WebSearch (already allowed)
7. WebFetch
8. Bash (mkdir already allowed, need more)

**Current Status**: Only WebSearch and Bash(mkdir:*) are allowed

**Required Additions**:
- Write (CRITICAL)
- Edit (CRITICAL)
- Read (CRITICAL)
- Glob
- Grep
- WebFetch
- Bash (expand beyond just mkdir)

---

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. Fix Architect Agent Config

**File**: `.claude/agents/architect.md`

**Change**:
```yaml
# FROM:
tools:
- Read
- Glob
- Grep

# TO:
tools:
- Read
- Write    # ADD THIS
- Edit     # ADD THIS
- Glob
- Grep
```

### 2. Update Settings.local.json

**File**: `.claude/settings.local.json`

**Change**:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read",
      "Write",
      "Edit",
      "Glob",
      "Grep",
      "WebSearch",
      "WebFetch",
      "Bash"
    ],
    "deny": [],
    "ask": []
  }
}
```

Note: Removed wildcard restriction on Bash to allow agents full bash access for running tests, builds, etc.

## Testing Plan

After fixes are applied:

### Test 1: Architect Agent File Creation
```bash
# Launch architect agent with task to create single test file
# Verify file is created in correct location
```

### Test 2: Narrative Writer File Creation
```bash
# Launch narrative-writer agent (already has Write/Edit)
# Verify files are created in correct location
# This tests if settings.local.json is the blocker
```

### Test 3: Full Planning Phase
```bash
# Re-run architect to create all planning documents
# Verify all 3 files created:
# - docs/plans/project-overview.md
# - docs/architecture/systems-map.md
# - docs/architecture/tech-specs.md
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Architect Failed

1. **Agent Config Issue**: Architect agent configured WITHOUT Write/Edit tools
2. **Permission Issue**: settings.local.json doesn't allow Write/Edit even if agent had them
3. **Cascading Failure**: Even though narrative-writer HAD Write/Edit tools, settings.local.json blocked execution

### Why Previous Fix Didn't Work

The AGENT_CONFIG_FIXES.md documented adding Write/Edit to all agents, but:
1. Architect was somehow excluded or reverted
2. Settings.local.json was never updated with required permissions
3. Agents can declare tools, but settings.local.json has final say on what's allowed

### Proper Fix Requires Both

1. ✅ Agent must declare tool in its config
2. ✅ Settings.local.json must allow that tool
3. Both conditions must be true for tool to work

---

## Summary

**Critical Issue**: Architect missing Write/Edit + Settings.local.json not allowing Write/Edit/Read

**Files to Fix**:
1. `.claude/agents/architect.md` - Add Write and Edit tools
2. `.claude/settings.local.json` - Allow Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, Bash

**Expected Outcome**: Agents will be able to create files when executed via Task tool
