# Autonomous Development Session #109 – Column Overlays & Telemetry Follow-Up

**Date**: November 1, 2025  \
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  \
**Duration**: ~2h10m  \
**Status**: Column overlay sourcing locked, overlay pipeline scaffolded, telemetry parity follow-up blocked by missing analytics dataset.

---

## Summary
- Closed the last AR-050 reference gap by sourcing CC BY imagery for all safehouse/checkpoint column beams and syncing metadata across `assets/images/requests.json` and `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`.
- Authored a reusable overlay derivative toolchain (`scripts/art/lib/overlayPipeline.js`, `scripts/art/generateOverlayDerivatives.js`, `assets/images/overlay-derivatives-act2-crossroads.json`) plus Jest coverage to automate tinting, cropping, and alpha curves for lighting overlays.
- Re-ran the analytics parity CLI to verify outbox ingestion; documented the missing `telemetry-artifacts/quest-telemetry-dashboard.json` dependency and logged the blocker in QUEST-610 and telemetry notes.

---

## Deliverables
- **Asset manifests**: Updated column overlay references in `assets/images/requests.json` and recorded sourcing rationale under Session 109 in `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`.
- **Overlay tooling**: Added configuration (`assets/images/overlay-derivatives-act2-crossroads.json`), processing library (`scripts/art/lib/overlayPipeline.js`), CLI (`scripts/art/generateOverlayDerivatives.js`), and npm entrypoint (`art:generate-crossroads-overlays`).
- **Tests**: Created `tests/scripts/art/overlayPipeline.test.js` covering merge, luma-to-alpha, and crop/tint operations.
- **Telemetry log**: Extended `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/outbox/act2-crossroads-20251112/README.md` with today’s failed parity retry and action items.
- **Backlog/docs sync**: Updated MCP items AR-050 & QUEST-610 and mirrored status in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- overlayPipeline` ✅
- `npm run telemetry:check-parity` ❌ – fails because `telemetry-artifacts/quest-telemetry-dashboard.json` is absent; analytics support required before the parity CLI can confirm ingestion.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **AR-001–AR-005 prompts** – Draft OpenAI generation briefs for UI tilesets and sprites called out in AR-050 next steps.
2. **Overlay derivatives** – Run `npm run art:generate-crossroads-overlays` once reference plates are downloaded locally; capture processing notes + output assets in manifests.
3. **Analytics acknowledgement** – Restore `telemetry-artifacts/quest-telemetry-dashboard.json` or obtain formal ingestion confirmation so the 2025-11-12 parity package can leave the outbox.
4. **RenderOps validation** – Coordinate the deferred Crossroads lighting preset pass after overlay derivatives are produced.

---

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050 (Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline)** – Next steps narrowed to AR-001–AR-005 prompt work and overlay derivative production; completed work now includes column beam sourcing.
- **QUEST-610 (Act 2 Crossroads Trigger Migration)** – Notes updated with the missing analytics dataset blocker; next steps clarify dependency on restored telemetry dashboard before scheduling the next parity run.

---

## Notes
- New overlay pipeline depends on `jimp` (dev dependency) and maps tint operations via hex-to-RGB conversion; see `scripts/art/lib/overlayPipeline.js` for operation hooks and reusable alpha-from-luma helper.
- Use `npm run art:generate-crossroads-overlays -- --dry-run` to sanity-check output dimensions before writing PNGs. Actual generation will stream source plates directly from the Openverse URLs captured in the config.
- Telemetry parity CLI should be re-run after analytics provide `quest-telemetry-dashboard.json`; document any acknowledgements in QUEST-610 and the parity README.
