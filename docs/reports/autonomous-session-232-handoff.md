# Autonomous Development Session #232 – Sprite Asset Hydration & RenderOps Staging

**Date**: 2025-11-22  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~90m  
**Focus**: Restore sprite rendering by wiring AssetManager hydration, expand automated coverage, and stage the latest Act 2 RenderOps delivery.

## Summary
- Registered the engine AssetManager with a shared sprite resolver and updated `Sprite` to hydrate string-backed images lazily, ensuring evidence sprites now render actual textures.
- Added targeted Jest coverage for sprite hydration paths and refreshed evidence entity tests to validate AssetManager integration.
- Staged the most recent Act 2 RenderOps packet for delivery, updating documentation/backlog to focus on approval acknowledgement.
- Synced backlog markdown with the new automation steps and closed BUG-344 in MCP.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/assets/assetResolver.js`, `src/game/Game.js:180`, `src/game/components/Sprite.js:1` — Introduced global asset resolver, registered the AssetManager during game bootstrap, and auto-hydrated sprites with caching/fallbacks.
- `tests/game/components/Sprite.assetLoading.test.js`, `tests/game/entities/EvidenceEntity.test.js` — Exercised manifest and URL fallback loading plus evidence sprite heuristics under the new resolver.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Recorded Session 231 backlog updates, refreshed next-session focus, and aligned AR-050 next steps with approval acknowledgement.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/components/Sprite.assetLoading.test.js tests/game/entities/EvidenceEntity.test.js`

## Automation & Assets
- `npm run art:stage-renderops -- --packet-dir reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T09-10-32-089Z`  
  Staged delivery contents at `deliveries/renderops/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T09-10-32-089Z` with updated PACKET_README and attachments ready for vendor handoff.

## Backlog Updates
- `BUG-344: Sprite rendering missing asset hydration` – **done** (sprite resolver + coverage, targeted Jest suite).
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` – Logged staging automation; remaining action is approval acknowledgement after QA review.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- `Act 3 Narrative (415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632)`: Await narrative copy for finale scripting/VO, then rerun `npx playwright test tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`.
- `AR-050`: Acknowledge RenderOps approval packet `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/act2-crossroads/2025-11-01T09:10:32.110Z-9cc27c03-3b58-4c29-8c71-36dfe28507ae.json` once lighting QA responds.
