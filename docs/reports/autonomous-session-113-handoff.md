# Autonomous Development Session #113 – Lighting Preview, Asset Queue, Telemetry Cadence

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h00m  
**Status**: Lighting preview harness online, AR-001–AR-005 prompts queued, telemetry cadence automated. Awaiting RenderOps feedback and generation outputs.

---

## Summary
- Implemented shared overlay analytics (`src/game/tools/OverlayStatCollector.js`) and the `Act2CrossroadsLightingPreviewer`, then wired `scripts/art/previewCrossroadsLighting.js` to emit `reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json` so RenderOps can spot underpowered segments before hardware sweeps.
- Queued all AR-001–AR-005 image prompts via `scripts/art/queueGenerationRequests.js`, producing `assets/images/generation-queue/2025-10-30T10-28-46-627Z-ar-001-ar-002-ar-003-ar-004-ar-005.jsonl` and advancing the relevant manifest entries in `assets/images/requests.json` to `generation-queued` with provisional licensing notes.
- Added `scripts/telemetry/planQuestTelemetryParity.js` to formalise parity cadence; the generated `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/parity-schedule.json` now tracks acknowledgement history and schedules the 2025-11-13 follow-up check.

## Deliverables
- Overlay tooling: `src/game/tools/OverlayStatCollector.js`, `src/game/tools/Act2CrossroadsLightingPreviewer.js`, `scripts/art/previewCrossroadsLighting.js`, `tests/game/tools/Act2CrossroadsLightingPreviewer.test.js`, report `reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json`.
- Asset pipeline: `scripts/art/queueGenerationRequests.js`, queue payload `assets/images/generation-queue/2025-10-30T10-28-46-627Z-ar-001-ar-002-ar-003-ar-004-ar-005.jsonl`, manifest updates in `assets/images/requests.json`.
- Telemetry cadence: `scripts/telemetry/planQuestTelemetryParity.js`, schedule output `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/parity-schedule.json`.
- Documentation/backlog refresh: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/guides/telemetry-parity-dispatch.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, MCP backlog items AR-050 & QUEST-610 updated with Session 113 notes.

## Verification
- `npm test -- Act2CrossroadsLightingPreviewer`
- `npm test -- Act2CrossroadsArtValidator`
- `node scripts/art/previewCrossroadsLighting.js --out=reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json`
- `node scripts/art/queueGenerationRequests.js`
- `node scripts/telemetry/planQuestTelemetryParity.js --interval-days=14`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **RenderOps lighting validation** – Review the under-target luminance readings highlighted in `reports/art/act2-crossroads-lighting-preview.json` and iterate on derivative tint/alpha settings if hotspots remain absent.
2. **AR-001–AR-005 asset approvals** – Run the queued generation batch, evaluate results against narrative/mechanics briefs, and replace provisional AI licensing metadata with final selections in `assets/images/requests.json`.
3. **Telemetry parity follow-up** – Monitor `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/parity-schedule.json`; trigger the next parity run or analytics ping as the 2025-11-13 check approaches.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` – Logged the lighting-preview harness and generation queue in completed work; next steps now focus on RenderOps review + processing the queued outputs.
- `QUEST-610: Act 2 Crossroads Trigger Migration` – Captured the new parity schedule in completed work and aligned next steps with the automated cadence tracker.
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Added Session 113 updates covering the lighting preview report, queued prompts, and refreshed next actions.
- `docs/guides/telemetry-parity-dispatch.md` – Documented the cadence planner CLI and how to interpret the schedule output alongside QUEST-610 updates.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Updated the AR-050 snapshot to reference the preview report and queued generation batch.

---

## Notes
- Lighting preview flagged significant under-target luminance for selection conduit, checkpoint glow, and both column sets—the RenderOps review should decide whether to raise alpha floors or adjust preset targets.
- Generation queue timestamps currently follow UTC (2025-10-30T10:28:46.627Z); keep downstream automation aware when reconciling with local production dates.
- Telemetry parity schedule currently reports no pending dispatch backlog; next check lands 2025-11-13T10:12:47.477Z unless analytics delivers earlier samples.
