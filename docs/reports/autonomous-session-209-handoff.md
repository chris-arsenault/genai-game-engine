# Autonomous Development Session #209 – Act 3 Stance Enablement

**Date**: 2025-11-17  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~90m  
**Focus**: Implement stance-aware Act 3 quest scaffolding, author finale epilogues, and execute the scheduled AR-050 automation sweep.

## Summary
- Implemented the `main-act3-gathering-support` quest with stance-specific objectives, new QuestManager hooks, and coverage tests; registered ten matching dialogues that emit `act3:gathering_support:milestone` events.
- Authored the Act 3 epilogue library plus exporter/CLI so ending cinematics consume scripted data; added Markdown overview and validation tests.
- Ran `npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2` (0 vendor updates yet) and `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`, archiving week-two progress and fresh luminance snapshots.
- Updated narrative and backlog docs to reflect completed focus items and queued the next Act 3 infiltration follow-ups.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/data/quests/act3GatheringSupportQuest.js`, `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js` — New stance-aware objectives, event hooks, and regression coverage (`tests/game/managers/QuestManager.act3.test.js`).
- `src/game/data/dialogues/Act3GatheringSupportDialogues.js` + tests — Ten automation-ready dialogue trees tied to quest milestones.
- `src/game/data/narrative/Act3EpilogueLibrary.js`, `src/game/tools/Act3EpilogueExporter.js`, `scripts/narrative/exportAct3Epilogues.js`, `tests/game/tools/Act3EpilogueExporter.test.js` — Epilogue data, exporter utilities, CLI, and Markdown render pipeline.
- Documentation: `docs/narrative/quests/act-3-quests.md`, `docs/narrative/epilogues/act-3-epilogues.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Updated with stance objectives, epilogue summaries, and refreshed Next Session Focus.
- Art automation artifacts: `reports/art/week2-bespoke-progress.json`, `reports/art/luminance-snapshots/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-luminance-2025-11-01T02-21-27-670Z.{json,md}`.

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`) — Logged quest/dialogue implementation, queued next steps for Zenith infiltration and finale cinematic wiring.
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** (`3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`) — Recorded week-two automation sweep outputs and noted dependency on incoming vendor payloads.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/narrative/quests/act-3-quests.md` — Detailed stance objectives, dialogue IDs, and automation hooks for `main-act3-gathering-support`.
- `docs/narrative/epilogues/act-3-epilogues.md` — Player-facing summaries of the three stance epilogues with key moments.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Marked completed focus items and added follow-up actions for Act 3 infiltration and finale sequencing.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Build `main-act3-zenith-infiltration` quest + scene triggers that consume the new stance flags and success markers.
- Integrate finale cinematics with the Act 3 epilogue exporter outputs and automate sequencing validation.
- Re-run the bespoke tracking sweep once vendor week-two updates arrive and package the RenderOps deliverables for archival.

## Verification
- `npm test` (full suite, 214 suites / 2501 tests passing).
- `npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2` (no updates applied; awaiting vendor payload).
- `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance` (12/12 segments within tolerance; snapshot archived).

## Metrics
- Content: 1 new Act 3 quest, 10 registered dialogues, 1 epilogue library/exporter pipeline.
- Automation: 3 new Jest suites validating quest, dialogue, and epilogue exports; 1 new CLI for epilogue reporting.
- Art Ops: Week-two bespoke progress + luminance snapshot archived for AR-050 tracking.
