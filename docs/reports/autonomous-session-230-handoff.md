# Autonomous Development Session #230 – Act 3 Finale Shared Overlay Integration

**Date**: 2025-11-22  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Wire the shared Act 3 memory well overlay into the finale presentation layer and lock automated coverage across stance branches.

## Summary
- Extended the finale cinematic manifest/runtime asset accessors to surface the shared memory well overlay alongside stance hero/beat panels, enabling consistent backdrop art across stances.
- Updated `FinaleCinematicOverlay` rendering to layer the shared panel behind hero art with graceful fallbacks, refreshed controller summaries, and sanitized visuals to carry the shared descriptor.
- Expanded Jest and Playwright coverage to assert shared overlay hydration/persistence and re-ran the full suites to validate the new rendering path.
- Synced MCP backlog (`Act 3 Narrative`) and `docs/plans/backlog.md` with the new deliverables plus refreshed narrative next steps.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/data/narrative/act3FinaleCinematicManifestData.js`, `src/game/data/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicAssets.js` — Added shared panel metadata/helpers for the finale manifest.
- `src/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicAssetManager.js`, `src/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.js` — Hydrate/serialize shared overlay descriptors alongside hero/beat assets.
- `src/game/ui/FinaleCinematicOverlay.js` — Render the shared memory well backdrop with hero art overlays and updated visual sanitization.
- Tests: `tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicAssetManager.test.js`, `tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js`, `tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js` — Assert shared overlay descriptors/visuals in unit and Playwright coverage.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Logged Session 230 backlog updates and refreshed high-priority focus/next steps for Act 3 Narrative.

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`): Recorded shared overlay integration/testing under `completed_work`, updated next steps to finale scripting/VO alignment and adaptive audio monitoring, and left status `in-progress` pending narrative polish.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Finalize Act 3 finale scripting/VO against the shared overlay, then rerun `npx playwright test tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js` to lock automation.
- Continue monitoring finale adaptive audio automation runs while additional stems are introduced.
- Execute the art automation bundle (`npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) to close RenderOps job `af361a7d-b05a-46f4-bf06-996e877f3dc5`.
- Decompose CORE-303 investigative loop tasks once CORE-301/302 dependencies are ready so work can remain automation-first.

## Verification
- `npm test`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`

## Metrics
- Updated code files: 6 gameplay/ui modules + 3 test suites + backlog doc.
- Automated suites executed: 1 full Jest run (219 suites / 2520 tests), 1 Playwright spec (3 scenarios).
- MCP backlog items updated: 1 (Act 3 Narrative).
