# Autonomous Development Session #76 – Adaptive Audio & Trigger Foundations
**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h35m  
**Status**: Mood-aware adaptive music scheduling, trigger zone state tracking, and rotation-ready room placement are now in place to support upcoming stealth and procedural milestones.

---

## Highlights
- Wrapped `AdaptiveMusicLayerController` with an `AdaptiveMusic` coordinator that exposes mood scheduling, timed reverts, and runtime mood definition updates for narrative-driven transitions.
- Hardened `TriggerSystem` with enter/exit tracking, ID/tag/component filters, and one-shot handling, backed by a dedicated `Trigger` component and Jest suite.
- Implemented rotation-aware transforms, bounds, and containment for `RoomInstance`, ensuring procedural layouts can place rotated rooms accurately and persist their dimensions.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusic.js` – High-level wrapper delegating to `AdaptiveMusicLayerController` with timed mood reversion support and mood registry helpers.
- `src/engine/physics/TriggerSystem.js`, `src/engine/physics/Trigger.js` – Stateful trigger processing with filtering, exit cleanup, and one-shot support.
- `src/engine/procedural/RoomInstance.js` – Rotation-aware coordinate conversions, bounds computation, and serialization of room dimensions.
- Tests: `tests/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusic.test.js`, `tests/engine/physics/TriggerSystem.test.js`, `tests/engine/procedural/RoomInstance.test.js` (expanded for rotations).
- Docs: Updated `docs/plans/audio-system-plan.md`, `docs/plans/sprint-4-architecture.md`, and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the new systems and coverage.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusic.test.js tests/engine/physics/TriggerSystem.test.js tests/engine/procedural/RoomInstance.test.js`

All targeted suites passed.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Integrate `AdaptiveMusic` into game loop orchestration (e.g., Game or scene controllers) so narrative systems can schedule moods without duplicate boilerplate.
2. Wire the new `Trigger` component into upcoming restricted-area and quest triggers, ensuring authoring tools populate radius/target metadata consistently.
3. Audit procedural generators to populate `RoomInstance.width/height` when instantiating rotated rooms so containment checks function across all templates.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Hook `AdaptiveMusic` into the stealth/combat audio pipelines and expose helper utilities to gameplay systems for mood transitions.
- Define trigger authoring schema (data + tooling) so designers can specify targets/tags without manual component assembly.
- Extend procedural placement tests to stress rotated rooms interacting with corridor generation.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Created and closed `AUDIO-410: AdaptiveMusic Mood Scheduler`, `PHYS-205: TriggerSystem Stateful Zone Events`, and `PROC-118: RoomInstance Rotation Support` to capture the delivered functionality.
- PO-002 remains closed per directive; no CI/reporting follow-ups scheduled until leadership re-enables that scope.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Directive reaffirmed: **do not** pursue CI or reporting work until explicitly reauthorized; all changes avoided pipeline modifications.
- No new benchmarks were required; current stealth audio benchmarks remain unchanged from Session #75.
