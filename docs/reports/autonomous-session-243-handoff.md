# Autonomous Development Session #243 – Deduction Board Pointer Routing
**Date**: 2025-11-26  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Enable live deduction board interaction by wiring canvas pointer events into the UI and locking coverage.

## Summary
- Introduced `DeductionBoardPointerController` to normalise canvas pointer coordinates and forward drag, hover, and right-click interactions directly to the deduction board overlay.
- Updated `Game` to instantiate and clean up the pointer controller alongside the board so runtime toggles immediately respect live CaseManager validation flows.
- Added targeted Jest coverage for the new controller and refreshed backlog documentation to push `M2-005` into active implementation with scripted verification notes.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/helpers/deductionBoardPointerController.js`
- `src/game/Game.js`
- `tests/game/ui/helpers/DeductionBoardPointerController.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- DeductionBoardPointerController`

## Backlog Updates
- `M2-005: Deduction Board UI (Basic)` → `in-progress` (runtime pointer routing, Jest coverage, documentation sync).

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Run the tutorial investigative loop automation once more to confirm deduction board interactions stay stable under scripted toggles.
- Profile overlay responsiveness after asset integration to ensure drag/drop remains comfortably within the 16 ms budget.
- Maintain standing follow-ups for `CORE-303`, `AR-050`, and staged faction ECS workstreams (`M3-003`) per prior sessions.
