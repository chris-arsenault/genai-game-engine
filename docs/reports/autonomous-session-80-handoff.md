# Autonomous Development Session #80 – Gameplay Bridge, Crime Scene Migration, Rotated Tilemaps
**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h40m  
**Status**: Implemented the gameplay adaptive audio bridge, migrated the Act 1 crime scene trigger onto the new toolkit, integrated rotated tilemaps into generation, and synced backlog/docs with full-suite verification green.

---

## Highlights
- Added `GameplayAdaptiveAudioBridge` to aggregate disguise/combat/scrambler telemetry into `AdaptiveMoodEmitter`, wired it into `Game.initializeAudioIntegrations()` with configurable update/hint windows, and covered behaviour with new Jest suites.
- Migrated the Act 1 crime scene area to `TriggerMigrationToolkit`, seeded `QuestTriggerRegistry` metadata (including mood hints), and documented the workflow update in the trigger authoring guide.
- Hooked `TileRotationMatrix` into `DistrictGenerator` so rotated rooms write correctly oriented tiles, expanding procedural tests to assert 90° placement.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/audio/GameplayAdaptiveAudioBridge.js`; updated `src/game/Game.js` lifecycle hooks and `src/game/config/GameConfig.js` audio toggles.
- Crime scene trigger migration in `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js` with registry seeding; new coverage `tests/game/scenes/Act1Scene.triggers.test.js`.
- Rotated tilemap integration in `src/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.js`; extended test `tests/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.test.js`.
- New audio bridge coverage `tests/game/audio/GameplayAdaptiveAudioBridge.test.js`.
- Documentation/backlog refresh: `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test` (full suite) – all 113 suites / 2072 tests passing (~28.5 s).

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Gameplay adaptive bridge (AUDIO-613)** – Need end-to-end integration test driving Disguise/Firewall events through `Game.update`, surface bridge diagnostics in audio overlays, and validate quest-driven mood hints once more triggers migrate.
2. **Act 1 trigger migration (QUEST-442)** – Vendor triggers, QuestSystem cleanup, and designer docs still pending; monitor registry seeding to avoid gaps after reset utilities run.
3. **Tilemap fidelity (PROC-221)** – Template variant resolver, tilemap transformer/corridor seam painter, and performance benchmarking remain before enabling rotated templates by default.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Build the adaptive audio integration test and telemetry overlay updates before enabling the bridge broadly.
- Migrate vendor InteractionZone flows to the toolkit, prune QuestSystem legacy paths, and finish documentation refresh.
- Design the variant resolver & seam painter layers for rotated tilemaps, capturing benchmarks during implementation.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated MCP backlog items `AUDIO-613`, `QUEST-442`, `PROC-221` with new completed work, next steps, and notes; mirrored progress in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- No new backlog entries or architecture decisions required this session.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Completed three development tasks plus documentation/backlog/handoff updates — autonomous run guardrails satisfied.
- Gameplay bridge configuration exposed via `GameConfig.audio.enableGameplayEmitters`/`gameplayMoodBridge` to support staged rollout.
- No asset sourcing actions during this session.
