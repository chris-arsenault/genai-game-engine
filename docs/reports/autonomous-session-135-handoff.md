# Autonomous Development Session #135 – Control Bindings Observation Heuristics

**Date**: November 5, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h 10m  
**Focus**: Turn control bindings observation telemetry into actionable UX heuristics across runtime tooling and exporter pipelines.

---

## Summary
- Surfaced control bindings observation summaries inside SaveInspector with dwell statistics, blocked ratios, and last-selection context for QA visibility.
- Enhanced `ControlBindingsObservationLog` to track dwell durations, longest hesitation, and navigation block ratios, exposing the data through `Game` inspector APIs and exporter sanitisation.
- Expanded the UX exporter CLI to render navigation heuristic tables and strengthened recommendation logic to react to hesitation/blockage patterns, with updated Jest coverage.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`, `src/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.js`: Inspector control bindings section with dwell/ratio display and sanitised summaries.
- `src/game/telemetry/ControlBindingsObservationLog.js`: Dwell tracking, ratio computation, summary serialization updates.
- `src/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.js`: Sanitised control bindings dwell/ratio payloads in inspector exports.
- `scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.js`: Navigation heuristics tables, upgraded recommendations, helper utilities.
- Tests: `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.test.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/ControlBindingsObservationLog.test.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js`, `tests/scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.test.js`.
- Docs: `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (Session #135 backlog notes and Unreleased entry).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.test.js tests/game/telemetry/ControlBindingsObservationLog.test.js tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js tests/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.test.js tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. `UX-410`: Execute the planned micro-playtests using the enhanced logging/exporter pipeline and capture qualitative findings for overlay refinements.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- MCP backlog items `UX-411`, `UX-412`, `UX-413` marked **Done** with dwell/heuristic deliverables recorded; `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the session update.
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` now highlights the new control bindings heuristics under Unreleased.

---

## Notes
- Recommendation thresholds: dwell average ≥2.5s, longest dwell ≥5s, selection block ratio ≥35%, paging block ratio ≥40%—revisit after initial micro-playtest data.
- Markdown heuristics include action labels for longest/last dwell to speed qualitative triage.
