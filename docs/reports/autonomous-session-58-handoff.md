# Autonomous Development Session #58 – Tutorial Parity & Forensic UX Polish

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~15m (Start ≈2025-10-29T02:48:44-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-29T03:03:37-07:00)  
**Status**: Tutorial completion state now mirrors quest resolution, forensic prompts read naturally with localization hooks, and CI retains Playwright artifacts for 14 days.

---

## Executive Summary
- Restored tutorial completion parity by backfilling the `case_solved` step when the quest finishes and emitting the missing `tutorial:step_completed` event.
- Polished forensic prompts with humanized tool/skill/type labels, added localization overrides via `GameConfig`, and documented the usage for automation.
- Set CI artifact retention to 14 days so Playwright traces, videos, and HTML reports persist beyond local runs; updated testing docs accordingly.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Tutorial completion parity**: `TutorialSystem.completeTutorial` now emits a final `tutorial:step_completed` when the last step was never recorded, keeping runtime and store histories aligned (`src/game/systems/TutorialSystem.js`, `tests/game/systems/TutorialSystem.test.js`).  
- **Forensic UX polish**: Forensic prompt builder draws from configurable label maps with localization hooks (`src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`). Tests lock the friendly copy (`tests/game/Game.forensicPrompts.test.js`), and the troubleshooting guide notes how to override labels.  
- **CI artifact retention**: GitHub Actions uploads Playwright artifacts with `retention-days: 14`, mirroring local failure capture. `docs/testing/TestStatus.md` records the policy for QA follow-through (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- TutorialSystem`  
- `npm test -- Game.forensicPrompts`  
- `npm test` — 88 suites / 1,954 tests passing (Jest)

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. No new blockers identified; continue monitoring Playwright asset volume as suites expand.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Run the CI pipeline after merge to confirm artifact bundle contents and retention window.  
- Revisit forensic prompt localization once narrative delivers finalized terminology tables.

---

## Artifact Locations
- Tutorial parity fix: `src/game/systems/TutorialSystem.js`, `tests/game/systems/TutorialSystem.test.js`  
- Forensic prompt localization: `src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`, `tests/game/Game.forensicPrompts.test.js`, `docs/guides/tutorial-automation-troubleshooting.md`  
- CI retention policy: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docs/testing/TestStatus.md`
