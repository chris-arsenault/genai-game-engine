# Autonomous Development Session #133 – HUD Binding Hint Parity

**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 30m  
**Focus**: Align remaining HUD overlays with dynamic control binding labels and capture next UX follow-ups.

---

## Summary
- Reworked the inventory, reputation, and save inspector overlays so their header hints resolve through `controlBindingPrompts`, keeping shortcut copy accurate after remapping.
- Added targeted Jest coverage to lock in the new hint rendering paths and ensure future refactors maintain parity.
- Logged a dedicated UX backlog item to gather player feedback on the revised overlay navigation flow before layering further polish.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.js`: Added binding hint helper utilities, rendered scroll/close/quest cues from the binding store, and trimmed output to fit existing layouts.
- `src/game/ui/ReputationUI.js`: Replaced hardcoded `[R] Close` prompt with binding-aware hints and shared formatting logic for additional navigation cues.
- `src/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.js`: Surfaced QA toggles via binding hints (close, controls menu, quest log) while preserving panel spacing.
- `tests/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.bindingHints.test.js`: New suite validating inventory overlay hint rendering against mocked bindings.
- `tests/game/ui/ReputationUI.test.js`: Extended coverage to assert binding-driven header hints.
- `tests/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.test.js`: Added expectations for the save inspector header prompts.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Documented Session #133 updates, including new backlog status entries.

---

## Verification
- `npm test` (full suite completed successfully before harness timeout)
- `npm test -- InventoryOverlay.bindingHints.test.js ReputationUI.test.js SaveInspectorOverlay.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. `UX-410`: Schedule micro-playtests to gather qualitative feedback on overlay navigation shortcuts and record recommendations.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- MCP backlog item `UI-610` marked **Done** with implementation/test notes; new item `UX-410` created for post-polish UX research.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` Session #133 section summarizes the HUD parity work and the UX feedback follow-up.

---

## Notes
- Binding hint strings now measure against available header width and drop the least critical entry when remapped labels get long, preventing overlap with existing typography.
