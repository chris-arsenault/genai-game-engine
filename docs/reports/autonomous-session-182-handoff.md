# Autonomous Development Session #182 – Kira Core Sprite Delivery

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Deliver bespoke AI-generated idle/walk/run sprite sheet for Kira and synchronize asset tracking for integration.

## Summary
- Generated a new 1024×1024 idle/walk/run sprite sheet for Kira via OpenAI gpt-image-1, preserving the 32×32 grid and neon-noir visual brief.
- Updated `assets/images/requests.json` to mark `image-ar-003-player-kira-sprite` as `ai-generated`, recorded provenance, and captured follow-up requirements.
- Documented the new asset in `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` and refreshed backlog notes (`docs/plans/backlog.md`, MCP AR-003) to steer the upcoming normalization and traversal QA work.

## Deliverables
- `assets/generated/images/ar-003/image-ar-003-kira-core-pack-bespoke.png`
- Manifests refreshed: `assets/images/requests.json` (AR-003), `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`
- Backlog alignment: `docs/plans/backlog.md` + MCP item AR-003 updates

## Verification
```bash
# Not run – asset sourcing only
```

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Run `python scripts/art/normalize_kira_evasion_pack.py` to merge the bespoke sheet into the normalized atlas and regenerate manifest data. (*AR-003*)
2. Execute `node scripts/art/updateKiraAnimationConfig.js`, swap the normalized atlas, and rerun traversal QA to confirm dash/slide transitions stay aligned. (*AR-003 / M3-016*)
3. Repackage Save/Load autosave assets after the bespoke swap so validator baselines and overlay captures reflect the final art. (*M3-016*)
4. Schedule the next narrative playtest sweep to confirm cascade telemetry remains stable now that faction state serializes through autosaves. (*M3-016*)
