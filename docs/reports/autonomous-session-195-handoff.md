# Autonomous Development Session #195 – Deduction Theory Validation Upgrade

**Date**: 2025-11-02  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~75m  
**Focus**: Ship M2-006 by hardening theory validation, hint surfacing, and coverage.

## Summary
- Introduced a reusable `TheoryValidator` module that evaluates player deduction graphs against multiple canonical solutions, enforces connection types, and synthesizes contextual hints.
- Integrated the validator into `CaseManager` and `DeductionSystem`, adding alternate tutorial theory paths, event bus hint payloads, and DeductionBoard feedback updates for multi-line guidance.
- Expanded Jest coverage across validator, manager, system, and UI layers to guard new behaviours; backlog/docs updated and item M2-006 moved to ready-for-review.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/data/TheoryValidator.js` (new validator module)
- `src/game/managers/CaseManager.js` (validator integration + hint propagation)
- `src/game/data/cases/tutorialCase.js` (alternate theory graph + connection allowances)
- `src/game/systems/DeductionSystem.js`, `src/game/ui/DeductionBoard.js` (hint events & multi-line feedback)
- `tests/game/data/TheoryValidator.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/CaseManager.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DeductionSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/DeductionBoard.test.js` (expanded coverage)
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session #195 notes, M2-006 status)

## Verification
- `npm test` → all suites pass except for the pre-existing `tests/engine/procedural/LayoutGraph.test.js` performance threshold flake (observed elapsed ~2.9–4.5 ms > 1 ms); rerun targeted suite reproduces the failure.
- Targeted `npm test -- TheoryValidator` confirms the new validator suite is green.

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. **LayoutGraph perf flake** – Threshold remains unrealistic under current load; needs separate triage/adjustment.
2. **AR-050** – Hold for 2025-11-07 RenderOps bespoke sweep (`npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2`) and feedback monitoring.
3. **M3-016 Telemetry checks** – Re-run telemetry outbox/ack audits during the 2025-11-07 automation window.
4. **UX-410** – Execute `node scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.js --label autosave-20251107` on 2025-11-07 and archive findings.

## Backlog & Coordination
- `M2-006: Deduction System and Theory Validation` is now **ready-for-review** with completed work notes logged in MCP; backlog markdown mirrored.
- WIP remains below the cap (AR-050, M3-016, M2-006 awaiting review). No new backlog items opened.
- Next session can either shepherd M2-006 through review/QA or tackle adjacent UX polish (M2-007) once the review lands.
