# Autonomous Development Session #244 – Deduction Board Automation Validation
**Date**: 2025-11-27  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Extend automated coverage so the tutorial flow validates deduction board pointer routing end-to-end.

## Summary
- Expanded the tutorial investigative loop Playwright spec to open the deduction board, drag clues into connections, and exercise board clearing through the live pointer controller.
- Added a reusable automation helper that maps canvas coordinates to viewport pointer events, ensuring future e2e scenarios can interact with the board without manual instrumenting.
- Synced backlog documentation for `M2-005` to capture the new automation milestone while leaving the pending profiling follow-up in place.

## Deliverables
- `tests/e2e/tutorial-investigative-loop.spec.js`
- `tests/e2e/utils/tutorialActions.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-investigative-loop.spec.js`
- `npm test -- DeductionBoardPointerController`

## Backlog Updates
- `M2-005: Deduction Board UI (Basic)` — recorded Playwright coverage of pointer-driven interactions; removed the automation loop follow-up and retained the profiling task.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Profile deduction board overlay responsiveness once art assets land to confirm drag/drop remains within the 16 ms target.
- Maintain standing follow-ups for `CORE-303`, `AR-050`, and staged faction ECS workstreams (`M3-003`) per prior sessions.
