# Autonomous Development Session #217 – Memory Parlor Neon Plate

**Date**: 2025-11-17  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~50m  
**Focus**: Generate the outstanding Memory Parlor neon infiltration plate and synchronize asset sourcing records.

## Summary
- Produced the `image-memory-parlor-neon-001` plate via GPT-Image-1 to cover the Memory Parlor stealth encounter with volumetric neon beams and modular cover lanes.
- Updated manifests and sourcing reports (`assets/images/requests.json`, `reports/art/neon-glow-approval-status.{json,md}`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`) to reflect the new ai-generated asset and document its provenance.
- Logged the asset sourcing progress inside the AR-050 backlog entry and backlog plan so follow-up metadata/integration work stays front-and-centre.

## Deliverables
- `assets/generated/ar-050/image-memory-parlor-neon-001.png` — Memory Parlor infiltration plate featuring cyan/magenta volumetric beams, firewall arcs, and stealth-ready cover silhouettes.
- `assets/images/requests.json`, `reports/art/neon-glow-approval-status.{json,md}`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Manifests and documentation updated with Session 217 sourcing notes, status history, and next-step tracking.

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** (`3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`): Added Session 217 asset generation notes to `completed_work` and appended a follow-up to produce Memory Parlor overlay metadata prior to scene integration.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Derive tiling/alpha metadata for `image-memory-parlor-neon-001` and integrate the plate into the Memory Parlor scene preview harness.
- Continue monitoring the week-two bespoke pipeline (`npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2`) and package the RenderOps payload once vendor updates land.

## Verification
- Asset generation only (`mcp__generate-image__generate_image`); no automated test suites executed this session.

## Metrics
- New neon infiltration plates generated: 1.
- Documentation/manifests synchronized: 4 files updated.
