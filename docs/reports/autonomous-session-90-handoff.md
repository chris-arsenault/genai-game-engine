# Autonomous Development Session #90 - Crossroads Navigation Guardrails & Telemetry Seeding  
**Date**: November 6, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h00m  
**Status**: Crossroads movement now respects the authored navigation mesh with branch-specific locks, Zara's branch selection triggers a dedicated landing overlay plus quest/telemetry updates, and telemetry baselines seed their history archive while surfacing artifact paths in CI summaries.

---

## Highlights
- Introduced `NavigationAgent` components and a `NavigationConstraintSystem` consumer so player/NPC traversal clamps to scene walkable surfaces until branch-specific unlocks fire, with PlayerMovement integrating the same safeguards.  
- Extended `CrossroadsPromptController` to unlock branch walkways, emit quest updates, and drive a new `CrossroadsBranchLandingOverlay`, providing UI feedback and checkpoint instructions tied to branch metadata.  
- Hardened `postPerformanceSummary.js` to seed the baseline history archive, expose baseline/history paths in markdown output, and refreshed guardrail docs plus Jest coverage to capture the new workflow.

---

## Deliverables
- Navigation Systems: `src/game/components/NavigationAgent.js`, `src/game/navigation/navigationUtils.js`, `src/game/systems/NavigationConstraintSystem.js`, `src/game/systems/PlayerMovementSystem.js`, `src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/entities/PlayerEntity.js`, `src/game/entities/NPCEntity.js`  
- Narrative/UI: `src/game/narrative/CrossroadsPromptController.js`, `src/game/ui/CrossroadsBranchLandingOverlay.js`, `tests/game/narrative/CrossroadsPromptController.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/NavigationConstraintSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/PlayerMovementSystem.navigation.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.systemRegistration.test.js`  
- Telemetry: `scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.js`, `scripts/telemetry/summarizePerformanceBaseline.js`, `tests/scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.test.js`, `tests/scripts/telemetry/summarizePerformanceBaseline.test.js`  
- Documentation: `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/performance/performance-baseline-guardrails.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/systems/NavigationConstraintSystem.test.js tests/game/systems/PlayerMovementSystem.navigation.test.js tests/game/narrative/CrossroadsPromptController.test.js`  
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/scripts/telemetry/summarizePerformanceBaseline.test.js tests/scripts/telemetry/postPerformanceSummary.test.js`  
- `npm test`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Crossroads art/nav integration** — Await final art/navigation assets and NPC pathing validation to confirm the new navigation constraints align with production geometry (`QUEST-610`).  
2. **Branch quest follow-through** — Selected branch quests/start scenes still need to consume the emitted landing events for full progression beats (`QUEST-610`).  
3. **Telemetry trend monitoring** — Confirm upcoming CI runs retain seeded history artifacts and review deltas before tightening thresholds (`PERF-119`).

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Review the next CI baseline summary to ensure the seeded history entry appears and delta annotations reference the archived file path.  
- Integrate art/navigation deliverables into the Crossroads scene and revalidate navigation constraints plus overlay placement.  
- Hook branch landing events into the subsequent quest/scene loaders so players transition cleanly after committing to a thread.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated `QUEST-610` with Session 90 navigation guardrails, branch landing overlay work, and pared next steps down to the remaining art integration.  
- Logged Session 90 telemetry seeding + summary enhancements under `PERF-119`, leaving CI validation/threshold tuning as the active follow-up.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- `NavigationConstraintSystem` listens for `navigation:unlockSurfaceTag`/`navigation:unlockSurfaceId` events, clamping transforms via polygon checks and emitting `navigation:movement_blocked` notices when surfaces remain locked.  
- Player movement now shares the same navigation enforcement, zeroes velocity when blocked, and records last valid positions through the attached `NavigationAgent`.  
- `CrossroadsPromptController` resolves thread metadata from `GameConfig`, unlocks walkway/ checkpoint surfaces, seeds quest updates, and pushes `crossroads:branch_landing_ready` for the overlay/UI.  
- Telemetry markdown summaries now list both the live baseline JSON and the archived history entry, while `ensureHistorySeeded` backfills empty history directories before delta evaluation.
