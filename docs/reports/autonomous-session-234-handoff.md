# Autonomous Development Session #234 – Investigation Loop Regression Fix

**Date**: 2025-11-22  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~75m  
**Focus**: Restore InvestigationSystem player detection to unblock the minimal investigative loop.

## Summary
- Restored player resolution by switching the InvestigationSystem update flow to rely on entity-manager tag queries (with a Transform guard), preventing the update loop from exiting before evidence scans execute.
- Added regression coverage that exercises both the tag-query path and the legacy fallback so automated tests catch future player lookup regressions.
- Synced backlog and documentation updates to mark CORE-303 as in-progress and capture the regression fix context.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js` — Player detection now pulls from `entityManager.getEntitiesByTag('player')` with an `entities` fallback, ensuring evidence and interaction checks run each frame.
- `tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js` — Added update-loop regression cases for tag-query and fallback flows to guard the fix.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Refreshed CORE-303 status, progress notes, and next steps after clearing the player lookup regression.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js`

## Backlog Updates
- `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton (020b1c60-a5e0-4641-b228-fde14dcee018)` — Status moved to in-progress; recorded the InvestigationSystem regression fix and queued tutorial evidence integration plus automation follow-up once CORE-301/302 land.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` — Await lighting QA sign-off before acknowledging RenderOps approval packet `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/act2-crossroads/2025-11-01T09:10:32.110Z-9cc27c03-3b58-4c29-8c71-36dfe28507ae.json`.
- `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton` — Integrate fixed InvestigationSystem into tutorial evidence beats and run investigative loop Playwright smoke once quest plumbing (CORE-301/302) is ready.
