# Autonomous Development Session #162 – AR-007 Particle Asset Generation

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 5m  
**Focus**: Generate in-house particle sprites for AR-007 and sync manifests/backlog for downstream VFX integration.

## Summary
- Generated rain, neon glow, and memory fragment particle sprite sheets through GPT-Image-1 and staged transparent assets under `assets/generated/ar-007/` to unblock AR-007 sourcing.
- Updated `assets/images/requests.json`, backlog item AR-007, and documentation to introduce the `ai-generated` status and capture remaining work on the screen effects pack and runtime validation.

## Deliverables
- `assets/generated/ar-007/image-ar-007-particles-rain.png`
- `assets/generated/ar-007/image-ar-007-particles-neon-glow.png`
- `assets/generated/ar-007/image-ar-007-particles-memory-fragment.png`
- Updated manifests/docs: `assets/images/requests.json`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- Manual inspection of generated particle sheets (visual review only)

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Email the QA distribution list with the staged save/load delivery contents and capture receipt in `deliveries/qa/save-load/.../qa-feedback-tracker.md`.
2. Record schema validation feedback from QA in the tracker and mirror any required adjustments back into backlog item M3-016.
3. Coordinate with the bespoke art scheduler to slot production time for `image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack` now that it is routed away from OpenAI generation.
4. Design and generate `image-ar-007-screen-effects-pack` overlays to complete the AR-007 bundle.
5. Integrate the new particle sheets into the VFX pipeline and validate additive blending/performance at 60 FPS before locking art.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated **AR-007: Particle Effects (M7)** via MCP: marked new particle sheets as completed work, set status to `in-progress`, refreshed next steps, and added notes referencing Session 162 docs.
- Logged `ai-generated` status and Session 162 progress in `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` and mirrored backlog state in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

## Assets & Media
- New AR-007 particle sprite sheets generated in-house via GPT-Image-1 with transparent backgrounds for additive blending; licensed for project use under internal generation terms and stored in `assets/generated/ar-007/` with provenance noted in the manifest.
