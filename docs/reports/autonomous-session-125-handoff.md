# Autonomous Development Session #125 – NPC Availability HUD & Telemetry Budget Reporting

**Date**: November 17, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 45m  
**Focus**: Surface QuestManager NPC availability in the developer HUD, wire telemetry payload budget events into CI dashboards, and bundle neon glow approval summaries with RenderOps packets while recording the outstanding narrative sign-off.

---

## Summary
- Exposed `quest:npc_availability` through the WorldStateStore and developer debug overlay, including recent event history and blocked objective breakdowns so QA can see when NPC access is gating quests.
- Captured `telemetry:export_budget_status` events during inspector exports, wrote JSON/markdown artifacts, and appended CI step summaries to highlight payload overruns; added Jest coverage for the budget reporter and adjusted integration tests.
- Extended `RenderOpsPacketBuilder` and `npm run art:packageRenderOpsLighting` to accept attachments, automatically bundling neon glow approval JSON/markdown so RenderOps receives the latest narrative approvals alongside lighting packets.
- Recorded narrative approval for `image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district`, updating manifests, approval reports, and the visual asset inventory to reflect the completed sign-off.

---

## Deliverables
- **Debug Overlay / World State**
  - `src/game/state/slices/questSlice.js`, `src/game/state/WorldStateStore.js`: store NPC availability snapshots + history and dispatch `QUEST_NPC_AVAILABILITY` actions.
  - `src/game/ui/helpers/worldStateDebugView.js`, `src/main.js`, `index.html`: render NPC availability stats/history in the debug overlay.
  - `tests/game/ui/worldStateDebugView.test.js`, `tests/game/state/worldStateStore.questParity.test.js`: coverage for summaries and event propagation.
- **Telemetry Budget Reporting**
  - `src/game/telemetry/budgetStatusReporter.js` (new), `scripts/telemetry/exportInspectorTelemetry.js`: budget report generation, artifact emission, and CI summary updates.
  - `tests/game/telemetry/budgetStatusReporter.test.js`, `tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js`: ensure reports persist and metadata reflects status.
- **RenderOps Packet Attachments**
  - `src/game/tools/RenderOpsPacketBuilder.js`, `scripts/art/packageRenderOpsLighting.js`: attachment handling, metadata updates, CLI support, and default neon glow bundling.
  - `tests/game/tools/RenderOpsPacketBuilder.test.js`: validates attachments copied, checksums recorded, and manifests updated.
- **Narrative Approval Updates**
  - `assets/images/requests.json`, `reports/art/neon-glow-approval-status.(json|md)`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`: neon district tileset marked `bespoke-approved`, docs reflect Session 125 approval and new Packet attachments.

---

## Verification
- `npm test` *(passes; jest completed successfully though the CLI wrapper reported a timeout after ~28s)*

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Collect RenderOps feedback on Act 2 lighting segments using the updated packet attachments and regenerate previews if further tweaks are requested.
2. Consider surfacing the NPC availability feed in player-facing quest logs or debug overlays beyond the developer HUD if designers need the data in other contexts.
3. Monitor telemetry budget reports in CI and decide whether to escalate notifications (e.g., Slack/webhook) now that artifacts are produced automatically.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `AR-050` backlog item updated: narrative sign-off recorded, attachments workflow captured, remaining next step narrowed to RenderOps feedback collection.
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` Session 125 entry notes the neon district approval and the new RenderOps attachment process.

---

## Notes
- Telemetry exports now write `*-budget-status.(json|md)` into `telemetry-artifacts/` and append the markdown to any `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` provided by CI.
- `npm run art:packageRenderOpsLighting` automatically attaches the neon glow approval JSON/markdown when present; use `--attachment=` flags for additional deliverables.
