# Autonomous Development Session #236 – Dialogue Input Wiring

**Date**: 2025-11-22  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~80m  
**Focus**: Restore keyboard control over dialogue choice, advance, and close actions while preventing unintended pause toggles during conversations.

## Summary
- Subscribed DialogueSystem to the dialogue UI `choice/advance/close` events so number keys, Enter/Space, and Escape now trigger the expected in-game interactions.
- Added a pause guard so Escape closes dialogue overlays instead of freezing the game, preserving the ability to unpause once conversations finish.
- Expanded DialogueSystem unit coverage to exercise the new event handling flow and reran DialogueBox/TutorialScene automation to confirm the regressions are fully resolved.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/systems/DialogueSystem.js` — Added listeners for dialogue UI events, improved requested/canonical dialogue bookkeeping, and cleared alias maps during cleanup.
- `src/game/Game.js` — Prevented pause toggles while dialogue overlays are visible.
- `tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js` — Introduced event-driven regression tests and updated the mocked event bus harness.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Logged Session #236 progress for CORE-303 and refreshed focus notes around the repaired input routing.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js tests/game/ui/DialogueBox.test.js tests/game/scenes/TutorialScene.triggers.test.js`

## Backlog Updates
- `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton (020b1c60-a5e0-4641-b228-fde14dcee018)` — Updated completed work with the dialogue input wiring, left next steps focused on integrating the repaired systems into the tutorial quest beats before Playwright validation.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` — Await lighting QA, then acknowledge RenderOps approval packet `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/act2-crossroads/2025-11-01T09:10:32.110Z-9cc27c03-3b58-4c29-8c71-36dfe28507ae.json`.
- `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton` — Fold the repaired investigation/dialogue wiring into tutorial quest beats once CORE-301/302 hooks land, then execute the investigative loop Playwright scenario to confirm end-to-end progression.*** End Patch
