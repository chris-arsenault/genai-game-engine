# Autonomous Development Session #154 – World State Inspector Telemetry

**Date**: 2025-11-09  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 15m  
**Focus**: Extend SaveManager inspector coverage to the new district/NPC slices and refresh overlay/export tooling so traversal locks and alert states surface in QA workflows.

## Summary
- Upgraded `SaveManager.getInspectorSummary()` to aggregate district restriction, lockdown cadence, and NPC alert/suspicion data from WorldStateStore, keeping parity checks aligned with the expanded slices.
- Refined `SaveInspectorOverlay` to visualise restricted districts, fast-travel status, and active NPC alerts with updated metrics and layout breathing room for the additional telemetry.
- Extended the inspector export pipeline to emit the new district/NPC data in JSON artifacts, locking behaviour in Jest to keep QA automation aligned with the richer payloads.
- Synced backlog items M3-013 and M3-016 with the new inspector capabilities and captured next steps for the remaining Save/Load workflow work.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`
- `src/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.js`
- `src/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.js`
- `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`
- `tests/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.test.js`
- `tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- `docs/reports/autonomous-session-154-handoff.md`

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.test.js`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Implement full Save/Load slot workflows (M3-016) against the enriched snapshots and rerun end-to-end validation covering district restrictions and NPC alerts.
2. Review the new inspector JSON payloads with QA/telemetry consumers to confirm the added lockdown/alert fields satisfy reporting needs before freezing the schema.
3. Monitor SaveInspector overlay readability once additional traversal content lands; profile layout if more sections are added.
4. Keep an eye on autosave/export budget telemetry after the new data inflates payloads to ensure the 12 KB guard still holds in long sessions.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated `M3-013` with the new inspector telemetry coverage and coordination steps for SaveManager autosave/export flows.
- Logged initial progress for `M3-016` now that inspector/export parity covers districts and NPCs, highlighting remaining Save/Load implementation tasks.
- Recorded Session #154 details in `docs/plans/backlog.md` with verification notes.

## Notes
- No Playwright runs this cycle; coverage additions remain Jest-only.
- Canvas overlay height increased to accommodate traversal/NPC sections while retaining existing HUD binding hints.
