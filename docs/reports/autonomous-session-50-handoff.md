# Autonomous Development Session #50 – Documentation Hygiene & Priority Grooming

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h45m (Start ≈2025-10-29T05:05:00Z – End ≈2025-10-29T06:50:00Z)  
**Status**: Documentation cleanup completed, archive policy established, backlog priorities refreshed for Session #50 follow-up.

---

## Executive Summary
- Consolidated legacy autonomous session reports into a dedicated `archive/docs/reports/` tree and relocated miscellaneous legacy notes to keep active docs focused.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` so all agents treat the archive as read-only historical context, preventing future loops from reopening retired deliverables.
- Groomed the development backlog with fresh high-priority entries, elevating combat audio validation and profiling tasks to the top of the queue with explicit next-session marching orders.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Archive hygiene**: Created `archive/` directory, moved autonomous session reports (Sessions 2–44) and stray historical summaries out of active doc space, and annotated backlog with archival pointers.
- **Agent guidance**: Added a workflow standard to `AGENTS.md` instructing agents to ignore archived files unless explicitly tasked, reducing noise during planning.
- **Priority refresh**: Revised `docs/plans/backlog.md` (v1.1) with Sprint 8 context, promoted `AUDIO-351`, `PERF-214`, and `UX-173` as the current P0/P1 efforts, and flagged `AUDIO-351` as the mandatory kickoff item for Session #50.

---

## Verification
- No automated tests executed (documentation-only session). Future validation: run targeted suites when combat audio verification work lands.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **AUDIO-351 – Combat/disguise trigger validation (P0)**: Requires real combat loop events to confirm routing; scheduled as the first task next session.
2. **PERF-214 – Browser-level profiling (P1)**: Must capture Chromium/Firefox traces to ensure adaptive audio + overlay stay within the 16 ms frame budget.
3. **UX-173 – Debug overlay ergonomics (P1)**: Keyboard navigation and focus handling remain unaddressed; needs design + coverage.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 52 archival moves + 2 updated docs + 1 new report.
- **New Directories**: `archive/`, `archive/docs/reports/`, `archive/misc/`.
- **Tests Run**: None (documentation pass).

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Open `AUDIO-351` immediately to verify live combat/disguise triggers and capture telemetry evidence.
- Plan parallel profiling sweep (`PERF-214`) once validation harness is in place.
- Slot UX accessibility work (`UX-173`) after combat verification to maintain designer workflow momentum.
