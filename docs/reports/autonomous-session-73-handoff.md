# Autonomous Development Session #73 – Telemetry Upload Fallback Hardening
**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h10m  
**Status**: Telemetry export tooling now records missing upload executables as tracked skips, keeping CI green while surfacing actionable metrics.

---

## Highlights
- Hardened `CiArtifactPublisher` to downgrade command-not-found failures into `status: skipped` results with `skippedReason: command_not_found`, preserving metadata output and EventBus telemetry even when GitHub CLI disappears.
- Expanded Jest and integration suites for the exporter to cover the new fallback path and assert skip instrumentation end-to-end.
- Refreshed `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` and PO-002 backlog notes to document the fallback behaviour and updated MCP backlog item with the new resilience milestone.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.js` – Added command-missing detection, structured skip records (`status`, `skippedReason`, `errorCode`), and logging so exports no longer throw when upload executables are absent.
- `tests/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.test.js` – New regression covering the ENOENT skip path alongside updated assertions for success cases.
- `tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js` – Integration scenario confirming skip recording when a configured command cannot spawn.
- `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` / `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Documentation and backlog progress notes referencing the new fallback workflow.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/CiArtifactPublisher.test.js tests/integration/telemetryExportTask.test.js`

All targeted suites passed.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. Monitor telemetry provider metrics for recurring `command_not_found` skips; sustained outages may require a REST-based artifact upload path.
2. Continue watching GitHub Actions logs to ensure skip records stay visible in step summaries after multiple consecutive runs.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Prototype a REST or Actions API upload fallback so telemetry artifacts can still attach automatically when the GitHub CLI remains unavailable.
- Audit guardrail benchmarks after integrating fallback logic to confirm WorldStateStore dispatch latency stays within the current 0.25 ms budget.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- MCP backlog item `PO-002` updated with the fallback milestone and refined next steps around REST-based uploads.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` progress log now notes Session #73 resilience work.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Skip records are stored with exit code `127` and surfaced through the CI summary reporter once provider scripts append results, keeping observability intact during CLI outages.
- Export pipeline remains benchmark-friendly; no additional allocations detected during targeted Jest runs.
