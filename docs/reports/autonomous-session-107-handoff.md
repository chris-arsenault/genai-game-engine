# Autonomous Development Session #107 - System Metrics Overlay & Asset Sourcing
**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2h10m  
**Status**: Debug overlay now surfaces live SystemManager metrics; AR-050 overlays partially sourced with CC-BY references; analytics ingestion remains pending confirmation.

---

## Highlights
- Added a SystemManager metrics panel to the debug overlay with per-system timing, entity counts, and budget highlighting, backed by `buildSystemMetricsDebugView`.
- Introduced Jest coverage for the new metrics view-model helper to lock formatting and threshold behaviour.
- Selected Creative Commons references for the Act 2 Crossroads selection conduit, checkpoint glow, and safehouse arc overlays and logged them in the asset inventory.
- Audited the analytics outbox package, noting ingestion is still awaiting confirmation and documenting follow-up in README/backlog.

---

## Deliverables
- Debug overlay: `index.html`, `src/main.js`, `src/game/ui/helpers/systemMetricsDebugView.js`.
- Tests: `tests/game/ui/helpers/systemMetricsDebugView.test.js`.
- Documentation: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- Asset manifest: `assets/images/requests.json`.
- Telemetry log: `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/outbox/act2-crossroads-20251112/README.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- systemMetricsDebugView`
- `npm test` *(command hit CLI timeout at ~28s, but Jest reported 147/147 suites green before termination)*

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **AR-050 overlays** – Remaining Crossroads assets (selection pad, checkpoint plaza, boundary walls) still require CC0/CC-BY references or generation prompts.
2. **RenderOps validation** – Hardware lighting preset re-run remains outstanding after renderer/overlay changes.
3. **Analytics ingestion** – `telemetry-artifacts/analytics/outbox/act2-crossroads-20251112` still sits in outbox with no acknowledgment; must confirm receipt before scheduling the next parity dispatch.
4. **Budget tuning UX** – Consider exposing the debug system budget override through the overlay/settings instead of the current `window.debugSystemBudgetMs` hook.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Continue AR-050 sourcing with a focus on selection pad, checkpoint plaza, and boundary wall overlays; prep generation briefs where web references fall short.
- Follow up with analytics to confirm ingestion of the `act2-crossroads-20251112` package and plan the next telemetry parity run.
- Schedule RenderOps’ lighting validation pass and capture any hotspot adjustments.
- Evaluate whether system metrics should emit to telemetry dashboards alongside the on-screen overlay.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Created and completed `DEBUG-318` (SystemManager metrics overlay) with tests and documentation logged in MCP.
- Updated `AR-050` with the three newly sourced references and refreshed next steps; backlog mirror updated.
- Appended QUEST-610 notes highlighting the pending analytics ingestion check.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- `window.debugSystemBudgetMs` can now override the default 4 ms per-system budget for overlay highlighting without code changes.
- `buildSystemMetricsDebugView` sorts systems by total time and applies warn/over-budget tones that map to new CSS styling tokens.
- Selected assets:
  - Tanozzo – *High Energy* (CC BY 2.0) for selection conduit plasma arcs.
  - MTAPhotos – *Reopening of 167 St on the B, D lines* (CC BY 2.0) for checkpoint strip lighting.
  - NASA Goddard – *Alien aurorae spotted on Uranus by Hubble* (CC BY 2.0) for safehouse arc aurora strands.
