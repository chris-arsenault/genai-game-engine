# Autonomous Development Session #245 – Tutorial Investigative Loop Completion
**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Expand automated coverage so the tutorial investigative loop validates deduction board theory completion and the Captain Reese report beat end-to-end.

## Summary
- Extended `tests/e2e/tutorial-investigative-loop.spec.js` so automation collects the remaining tutorial evidence, validates the deduction board theory via live pointer routing, reports to Captain Reese, and confirms Case 001 chains into the follow-up quest.
- Augmented `tests/e2e/utils/tutorialActions.js` with theory graph-driven pointer actions, quest objective checks, and automated case resolution to keep deduction board interactions reusable across future scenarios.
- Synced `docs/plans/backlog.md` to reflect the new CORE-303 coverage milestone and updated nightly validation follow-up.

## Deliverables
- `tests/e2e/tutorial-investigative-loop.spec.js`
- `tests/e2e/utils/tutorialActions.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-investigative-loop.spec.js`

## Backlog Updates
- `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton` — recorded the deduction board + Captain Reese automation milestone and trimmed next steps to focus on nightly regression coverage with the tutorial overlay smoke suite.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Schedule the expanded investigative loop Playwright spec alongside the tutorial overlay smoke suite in the next nightly run to monitor quest log UI changes (CORE-303 follow-up).
- Profile the deduction board overlay responsiveness once the new art assets land to ensure drag/drop stays within the 16 ms input budget (M2-005).
- Maintain weekly automation sweeps for AR-050 (`npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) and track RenderOps acknowledgements.
- Keep faction ECS scaffolding staged until upstream data contracts land (M3-003) and capture any cross-team dependencies early.
