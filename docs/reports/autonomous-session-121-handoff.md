# Autonomous Development Session #121 – Lifecycle QA & Bespoke Tracking

**Date**: November 14, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~2h 25m  
**Focus**: Entity respawn validation, spatial hash telemetry smoothing, and bespoke art tracking automation.

---

## Summary
- Added an integration harness that exercises EntityManager → Quest/Faction hooks, proving NPC respawns clear quest blockers and feed faction telemetry into inspector summaries.
- Enhanced `SpatialHash` to retain rolling metrics with configurable windows and updated the debug overlay to surface averages for stealth tuning.
- Automated Week 1 bespoke deliverable ingestion, updating manifests/licensing and emitting progress reports + documentation for art ops.

---

## Deliverables
- **Engine / Gameplay**
  - `tests/integration/entityLifecycle.questFaction.integration.test.js`: End-to-end coverage for NPC despawn/respawn flows plus faction removal telemetry checks.
  - `src/engine/physics/SpatialHash.js`, `src/engine/physics/CollisionSystem.js`: Rolling metrics history, `setMetricsWindow`, history reset, and collision system wiring.
  - `src/main.js`: Debug overlay copy extended to show rolling averages and sample window signatures.
  - `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`, `src/game/telemetry/inspectorTelemetryExporter.js`: Inspector summaries now surface recent faction removals with sanitized analytics payloads.
- **Operations & Assets**
  - `scripts/art/trackBespokeDeliverables.js`: CLI to merge scheduled bespoke statuses into manifests and publish progress JSON.
  - `reports/art/bespoke-week1-tracking.json`, `reports/art/week1-bespoke-progress.json`: Week 1 vendor updates + summary counts.
  - `assets/images/requests.json`, `assets/bespoke/week1/README.md`: Manifest entries advanced to bespoke-approved/in-review/pending with licensing, reviewer, and deliverable paths logged.
  - `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`: Status glossary expanded; Session 121 notes capture automation flow and approval state.
- **Planning**
  - `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Session 121 backlog updates for M1-002, M1-012, and AR-050, plus refreshed summary table.

## Verification
- `npm test` (full Jest suite) – PASS @ 2025-11-14 06:19 UTC (~28s).

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Expand Playwright/debug HUD coverage to assert spatial hash rolling metrics render correctly once more systems consume them (`M1-002` / `M1-012`).
2. Profile stealth encounters with alternative metric windows to tune the default 120-frame history and gauge telemetry export impact (`M1-012`).
3. Track Week 1 bespoke revisions (clue node glow variant, neon district polish) and log approvals/licensing via the new CLI (`AR-050`).

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- `M1-002`, `M1-012`, and `AR-050` refreshed in MCP with new completed work and follow-up actions.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` and `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` mirror the latest integration/test status and bespoke approvals.
- New operational artifacts (`reports/art/week1-bespoke-progress.json`, `assets/bespoke/week1/README.md`) catalog Week 1 art deliverables for ongoing ops coordination.

---

## Notes
- Rolling metrics sampling defaults to 120 frames; call `setMetricsWindow()` in future encounters to experiment with stealth density and telemetry precision.
- Bespoke tracking CLI writes directly to `assets/images/requests.json`; stage updates via `reports/art/bespoke-weekX-tracking.json` to keep audit trails intact.
