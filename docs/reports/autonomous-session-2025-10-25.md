## 1. Research Findings

### Genre Recommendation: Metroidvania + Investigation/Mystery

**Primary Recommendation**: Metroidvania exploration with investigation mechanics
- **Physical Progression**: Traditional ability-gated exploration (double-jump, dash, etc.)
- **Knowledge Progression**: Investigation gates requiring deduction to proceed
- **Unique Synergy**: "Temporal Echoes" serve both exploration AND investigation
- **Technical Feasibility**: HIGH - all systems achievable with vanilla JS/Canvas

**Alternative Options Researched**:
1. Roguelike + Faction Diplomacy (excellent replayability)
2. Tactical Combat + Environmental Puzzle Platformer (higher complexity)
3. Survival Crafting + Narrative Investigation (resource tension)
4. Action-Rhythm + Dynamic World Events (technical challenges with web audio)

**Key Supporting Documents**:
- `docs/research/gameplay/genre-analysis-2025-10-25.md` (40+ sections, ~12,000 words)
- `docs/research/mechanics-analysis.md` (Tier 1-3 mechanics with synergy matrix)
- `docs/research/engine-architecture.md` (Technical specifications for Canvas/JS)

---

## 2. Core Mechanics Designed

### Tier 1: MVP Differentiators

#### 1. Temporal Echo System
**Concept**: Player witnesses "recordings" of past events overlaid on present reality
- Toggle Echo Sight to reveal historical scenes
- Collect evidence from echo observations
- Past and present can interact (limited)
- Memory/sanity mechanic - overuse causes degradation

**Narrative Integration**: Investigation tool AND storytelling device

#### 2. Adaptive Faction Ecosystem
**Concept**: 5 factions with AI-driven goals, competing for territory
- Remembrance Society (authoritarian truth control)
- Truth Seekers (radical transparency)
- Memory Keepers (compassionate erasure)
- Temporal Purists (reality fundamentalists)
- Gray Chorus (hidden, advocates individual agency)

**Player Impact**: Reputation system affects access, quests, world state, endings

#### 3. Material Interaction System
**Concept**: Simplified Noita-style physics with 8 material types
- Fire propagates through flammable materials
- Water conducts electricity, extinguishes fire
- Ice creates platforms, slows time locally
- Temporal corruption spreads as conspiracy device

**Performance**: 30Hz update rate, dirty rectangles, limited simulation zones

### Tier 2: Post-MVP Enhancements
- Modular crafting with component disassembly
- Knowledge graph progression (Outer Wilds-inspired)
- Reactive AI with memory (simplified Nemesis system)

### Tier 3: Polish Features
- Day/night & weather systems with mechanical impact
- Advanced particle effects
- Dynamic music system

**Key Synergies**:
- Faction wars spread material corruption
- Echoes trigger environmental interactions remotely
- Weather affects material propagation rules
- NPC memories influence faction relationships

---

## 3. Technical Architecture

### Entity-Component-System (ECS) Foundation

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Core classes created
- `Entity.js` - Lightweight ID wrapper with component management
- `Component.js` - Base data-only structure
- `System.js` - Logic processor operating on entities
- `EntityManager.js` - Central registry and query system
- `EventBus.js` - Global pub/sub for decoupled communication

**Design Principles**:
- Data-oriented: Components store state, systems provide logic
- Event-driven: Systems communicate via EventBus
- Performance-first: Object pooling, spatial hashing, 60 FPS target

### Rendering Pipeline (Planned)

**Architecture**: Canvas 2D with layer-based rendering
- Frustum culling (don't render off-screen)
- Sprite batching (reduce draw calls)
- Layer system (BACKGROUND, WORLD, ECHO_OVERLAY, ENTITIES, PARTICLES, UI)
- Camera with smooth following and deadzone

**Performance Budget**: <10ms per frame

### Physics System (Planned)

**Approach**: Discrete collision with spatial hashing
- Broad phase: 64x64 spatial hash grid
- Narrow phase: AABB, circle, polygon collision
- Simple impulse-based resolution
- Sleeping for static bodies

**Performance Budget**: <3ms per frame

## 4. Narrative Vision: "Echoes of the Verdict"

### Story Summary

**Protagonist**: Silas Crane, disgraced detective with echo-sensitivity
**Inciting Incident**: Mentor (Chief Inspector Marlowe Ash) found dead in locked room
**Central Mystery**: Murder investigation reveals conspiracy about "Echo Protocol"
**Conspiracy**: Technology that edits memories and retroactively alters history
**Stakes**: City exists in quantum superposition of multiple pasts; choosing one truth erases others

### World Building

**Setting**: New Tenebrae, neo-noir city in perpetual twilight
- Art Deco meets occult symbolism
- Six interconnected districts (Sinking Ward → Echo Yards)
- Temporal echoes manifest from "Shroud Event" 20 years ago

**Tone**: Film noir + cosmic horror + philosophical mystery

### Five Factions (Detailed)

Each faction represents valid philosophical response to Echo Protocol:

1. **Remembrance Society**: Controls Protocol, edits history for "stability"
   - Leader: Councilor Elara Voss
   - Goal: Maintain order through curated truth
   - Player Path: Order ending (protagonist becomes new controller)

2. **Truth Seekers**: Resistance fighting for authentic reality
   - Leader: Evangeline "Ev" Thorne (radio host)
   - Goal: Expose conspiracy, destroy Protocol infrastructure
   - Player Path: Revelation ending (chaos, but democratic rebirth)

3. **Memory Keepers**: Offer "compassionate" memory erasure
   - Leader: Dr. Sienna Lark
   - Goal: Alleviate suffering through selective amnesia
   - Player Path: Manipulation of masses for "their own good"

4. **Temporal Purists**: Doomsday cult seeking Protocol destruction
   - Leader: The Prophet (Elijah Strand, former physicist)
   - Goal: Restore causality, even if it collapses reality
   - Player Path: Collapse ending (reality fractures completely)

5. **Gray Chorus**: Hidden network advocating individual agency
   - Leader: Marlowe Ash (posthumously), Silas becomes successor
   - Goal: Decentralize Protocol so individuals control own truths
   - Player Path: Synthesis ending (best ending, hardest to achieve)

### Five Distinct Endings

**Requirements-Based**: Faction reputation + investigation completion determines outcome

1. **Remembrance Protocol** (Society): Authoritarian order, protagonist complicit
2. **The Collapse** (Purists): Reality destruction, protagonist becomes echo
3. **The Revelation** (Seekers): Truth exposed, violent upheaval, protagonist exiled
4. **The Synthesis** (Gray Chorus): Decentralized Protocol, free will restored (requires perfect investigation)
5. **The Madness** (Failure): Unreliable narrator, surreal ending (low memory integrity)

### Act Structure

**Act 1 (Chapters 1-2)**: Locked room mystery, establish world, introduce factions
**Act 2 (Chapters 3-4)**: Conspiracy escalates, faction allegiance choice, reveal Shroud Event
**Act 3 (Chapter 5)**: Convergence at Echo Yards, final choice, ending determination

**Key Documents**:
- `docs/narrative/vision.md` - Complete narrative design (~30,000 words)

## 10. Outstanding Questions & Decisions Needed

### Technical Decisions

1. **Physics Library**: Custom AABB or use Matter.js?
   - **Recommendation**: Start custom, add Matter.js if complexity grows
   - **Rationale**: Metroidvania physics are relatively simple

2. **Audio System**: Web Audio API directly or library (Howler.js)?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with Web Audio API
   - **Rationale**: Maintain "vanilla JS" constraint, learn fundamentals

3. **Asset Loading**: Priority queue or zone-based chunks?
   - **Recommendation**: Zone-based lazy loading
   - **Rationale**: Metroidvania structure naturally supports this

### Gameplay Decisions

1. **Combat System**: Real-time action or turn-based tactical?
   - **From Vision**: Real-time action (standard Metroidvania)
   - **Status**: Not yet specified in detail - needs gameplay-dev agent

2. **Save System**: Auto-save, manual checkpoints, or both?
   - **Recommendation**: Checkpoints + manual save (investigation progress)
   - **Rationale**: Investigation state is complex, needs explicit save

3. **Difficulty Modes**: Single difficulty or multiple?
   - **Recommendation**: Start single, add modes post-MVP
   - **Rationale**: Narrative-focused games benefit from accessibility options

### Narrative Decisions

1. **Voice Acting**: Text-only or partial voice?
   - **Recommendation**: Text-only (medium complexity scope)
   - **Status**: Asset request for VO can be logged if budget allows

2. **Procedural Mystery Scope**: How many templates for side cases?
   - **Recommendation**: 3-5 templates for MVP, expand post-launch
   - **Rationale**: Hand-crafted quality > quantity for story-driven game

---

## 13. Recommendations for Human Review

### Strengths of Current Approach

✅ **Focused Scope**: Medium complexity target is achievable with clear MVP definition
✅ **Unique Identity**: Metroidvania + Investigation hybrid is underexplored market niche
✅ **Technical Feasibility**: All systems proven achievable with vanilla JS/Canvas
✅ **Narrative Depth**: Philosophical themes and faction dynamics create replayability
✅ **Modular Architecture**: ECS + event-driven design supports parallel development

### Potential Concerns

⚠️ **Narrative Writing Burden**: Investigation mechanics require significant content creation
- **Mitigation**: Procedural mystery templates for side content, focus quality on main cases

⚠️ **Performance Complexity**: Temporal echoes + material simulation + faction AI simultaneously
- **Mitigation**: Strict performance budgets allocated, LOD systems planned, continuous profiling

⚠️ **Faction Balance**: Risk of one philosophy dominating player choice
- **Mitigation**: Playtest early, ensure all paths equally compelling, unique rewards per faction

⚠️ **Art Asset Volume**: 6 districts * multiple layers = substantial visual content needed
- **Mitigation**: Procedural variation, palette swaps, modular tileset design to maximize reuse

### Proposed Adjustments (Optional)

**If Scope Feels Too Large**:
1. Reduce districts from 6 to 4 (merge Mercantile Heights + Sovereign Terrace)
2. Cut 1-2 factions (keep Society, Seekers, Gray Chorus as minimum)
3. Simplify material system (2-3 types instead of 8)

**If Scope Feels Too Small**:
1. Add procedural dungeon generation for Echo Yards
2. Expand crafting system to full modular gear assembly
3. Implement New Game+ with faction perspective shifts

---

Phase 0 (Project Bootstrap) is **COMPLETE and SUCCESSFUL**.

The project now has:
- ✅ Clear vision and scope
- ✅ Technical foundation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Narrative framework
- ✅ Infrastructure ready for development

**Recommendation**: Proceed to Phase 1 (Foundation) implementation.

**Estimated Timeline**:
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 3-4 weeks
