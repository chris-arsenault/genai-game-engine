# Autonomous Development Session #56 – Forensic Prompt Parity & Tutorial Alignment

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~120m (Start ≈2025-10-30T02:05:00Z – End ≈2025-10-30T04:05:00Z)  
**Status**: Forensic analysis is now driven through the in-game prompt, tutorial scene scaffolding reuses the live Act 1 loader, and automation captures full artifacts on failure.

---

## Executive Summary
- Integrated a prompt-driven forensic workflow so players and automation share the same `KeyF` interaction, eliminating direct `ForensicSystem` calls in Playwright.
- Refactored `TutorialScene` to reuse `loadAct1Scene`, ensuring tutorial automation exercises the exact runtime entity/evidence layout.
- Hardened the tutorial Playwright suite with prompt waits, id-based evidence helpers, and per-test artifact capture for easier regression triage.
- Updated troubleshooting guidance and backlog to reflect the new forensic prompt flow and tutorial scene alignment.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Forensic Prompt Overlay**: `Game` now queues `forensic:available` events, renders interaction text, and triggers analysis via `KeyF`, with helper methods to locate evidence entities (`src/game/Game.js`).
- **CaseManager Utility**: Added `getEvidenceDefinition` to support UI/tooling lookups and expanded Jest coverage (`src/game/managers/CaseManager.js`, `tests/game/managers/CaseManager.test.js`).
- **Tutorial Scene Parity**: `TutorialScene.load()` delegates to `loadAct1Scene`, caches spawned entities, and cleans them on unload for parity with runtime (`src/game/scenes/TutorialScene.js`).
- **Playwright Improvements**: Tutorial spec now waits for forensic prompts, collects evidence by id, records artifacts on failure, and completes the deduction flow without direct system hooks (`tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js`).
- **Documentation & Backlog**: Troubleshooting guide details the prompt-driven forensic flow; backlog file and MCP items updated with UX-182 & QA-274 completion.

---

## Verification
- `npm test` — 87 suites / 1,949 tests passing (Jest).
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-overlay.spec.js` — 7 tutorial E2E scenarios passing with artifact capture enabled.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Tutorial `case_solved` tracking**: `TutorialSystem.completedSteps` still omits `case_solved`; we currently rely on store context to assert completion. Consider auditing the final step emission so completed steps reflect the solved state.
2. **Forensic prompt UX polish**: Prompt currently displays raw requirement ids (`tool basic_magnifier`). Future UX pass could map requirement ids to player-friendly labels.
3. **Artifact retention config**: Playwright `afterEach` attaches screenshots/videos locally; ensure CI pipeline mirrors the same attachment policy when Playwright suites expand.

---

## Follow-up / Next Session Starting Points
- Investigate why `case_solved` is absent from `TutorialSystem.completedSteps` despite store context completion, and align tutorial shutdown logic accordingly.
- Format forensic requirement strings (tool/skill names) for player-facing clarity and add localization hooks if needed.
- Propagate Playwright artifact retention settings into CI configuration to guarantee traceability outside local runs.
