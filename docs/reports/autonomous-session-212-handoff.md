# Autonomous Development Session #212 – Finale Cinematic Playback Layer

**Date**: 2025-11-18  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~95m  
**Focus**: Bridge finale readiness payloads into an interactive playback layer with automation coverage.

## Summary
- Introduced `Act3FinaleCinematicController` to consume the sequencer payload, drive beat progression, emit adaptive finale music cues, and broadcast lifecycle events for downstream playback orchestration.
- Shipped the `FinaleCinematicOverlay` canvas HUD that surfaces stance summaries, epilogue beats, and input prompts while respecting overlay visibility telemetry.
- Integrated the controller/overlay into `Game.initializeUIOverlays` and `initializeNarrativeControllers`, including cleanup paths and render/update wiring so finale playback survives scene reloads.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.js`: Finale controller handling readiness events, adaptive music emission, beat advancement, skip/abort flows, and lifecycle telemetry (`narrative:finale_cinematic_{begin,beat_advanced,completed,skipped,abandoned}`).
- `src/game/ui/FinaleCinematicOverlay.js`: Cinematic HUD overlay rendering stance context, epilogue beat progression, and binding-aware prompts with overlay visibility events.
- `src/game/Game.js`: Registered the overlay/controller, ensured render/update participation, and extended cleanup/initialisation routines for the finale playback stack.
- `docs/narrative/quests/act-3-quests.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Documented the new playback layer and logged Session 212 progress in the backlog overview.
- `tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js`: Jest coverage for readiness handling, beat advancement, skip flow, and adaptive music emission.

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`) — Logged Session 212 deliverables, replaced the playback integration next step with hooking bespoke cinematic assets into the new pipeline, and noted the new controller coverage.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Author stance-specific Zenith infiltration dialogue beats once scene layouts are locked.
- Integrate bespoke finale cinematic asset playback once renders land, leveraging the new controller lifecycle hooks.
- Schedule Playwright coverage for the Zenith route to validate trigger sequencing through the finale readiness and playback flow.

## Verification
- `CI=1 npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js`
  - Note: A full `npm test` invocation reached completion (all 216 suites passed) but exceeded the harness timeout (~14s); retained logs for traceability.

## Metrics
- UI Overlays: +1 (`FinaleCinematicOverlay`)
- Runtime Events: +5 finale lifecycle events (`narrative:finale_cinematic_begin`, `...beat_advanced`, `...completed`, `...skipped`, `...abandoned`)
- Automation: +1 Jest suite (3 tests) covering finale playback controller behaviours.
