# Autonomous Development Session #66 – Telemetry Export Integration Architecture

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h05m (Start ≈2025-10-30T12:05-07:00 – End ≈2025-10-30T13:10-07:00)  
**Status**: Telemetry export integration and tutorial transcript architecture defined; monitoring strategy documented; backlog/test strategy synced.

---

## Highlights
- Authored `docs/plans/telemetry-export-integration-plan.md` detailing the TelemetryArtifactWriterAdapter, filesystem/CI writers, CLI task, and Playwright helper required to operationalize `SaveManager.exportInspectorSummary()` in automation.
- Produced `docs/plans/tutorial-transcript-export-plan.md`, specifying the TutorialTranscriptRecorder/serializer workflow to expose full tutorial transcripts through telemetry artifacts.
- Extended `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` with telemetry export monitoring guidance, including benchmark guardrails, CI verification commands, and Playwright diagnostics.
- Updated backlog item `PO-002` (WorldStateStore Observability) with phased next steps and notes referencing the new plans; stored architecture decisions (`f2c6d3e0-…`, `55b49c5f-…`) and a telemetry export test strategy (`48ecfd46-…`).

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/telemetry-export-integration-plan.md`
- `docs/plans/tutorial-transcript-export-plan.md`
- `docs/tech/world-state-store.md` (Telemetry Export Monitoring section + verification commands)
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` (PO-002 progress note)
- MCP updates: backlog `PO-002` next steps/notes, architecture decisions, telemetry export test strategy.

---

## Verification
- ⛔️ No automated suites executed this session (documentation/architecture focus).  
- Recommended follow-ups once implementation lands:  
  - `npm test -- SaveManager`  
  - `npm test -- inspectorTelemetryExporter`  
  - `npm test -- telemetry` (new adapter/recorder suites)  
  - `npx playwright test tests/e2e/cascade-mission-telemetry.spec.js`  
  - `npx playwright test tests/e2e/tutorial-transcript-telemetry.spec.js` (after creation)  
  - `node benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js`  
  - `node benchmarks/telemetry-export-writer.js` (new benchmark)

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Implement TelemetryArtifactWriterAdapter + FileSystemTelemetryWriter (Phase 1)**  
   - Ensure adapter metrics and EventBus emissions land; cover fan-out/error isolation with Jest.
2. **Build export CLI + CI publisher (Phase 2)**  
   - Wire into CI pipeline, introduce dry-run mode, capture summary JSON for artifact upload jobs.
3. **Integrate tutorial transcript recorder + exporter (Phase A/B)**  
   - Keep transcript buffer bounded; add serializer outputs (JSON/CSV/Markdown) in SaveManager.
4. **Playwright + documentation updates (Phase 3/C)**  
   - Share telemetry helper across missions/tutorials, attach artifacts, update tutorial automation guide.
5. **Performance guardrail monitoring**  
   - Re-run dispatch benchmark after each integration; investigate if mean latency rises above +0.01 ms variance.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Begin Phase 1 implementation of telemetry writer adapter (per plan) and add corresponding Jest suites.  
- Prototype `benchmarks/telemetry-export-writer.js` to baseline artifact write timings before CI integration.  
- Prepare CLI scaffolding (argument parsing, dry-run logging) ahead of CI pipeline wiring.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- `PO-002` next steps/notes refreshed; remains `in-progress` with phased tasks.  
- Architecture decisions stored for telemetry adapter and tutorial transcript recorder.  
- Test strategy `Telemetry Export Integration Verification` recorded (status `planned`).  
- Ensure future sessions link implementation PRs and benchmark results back to the backlog item.

---

## Metrics
- No new benchmark executions; last confirmed `dispatchMeanMs` remains **0.0100 ms** per Session #65 report.  
- New benchmark target introduced: telemetry writers <10 ms per artifact on CI hardware.
