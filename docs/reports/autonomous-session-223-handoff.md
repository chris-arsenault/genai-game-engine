# Autonomous Development Session #223 – RenderOps Delivery Acknowledgement

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Stage the refreshed Act 2 Crossroads RenderOps packet for delivery, close out the pending approval, and synchronize telemetry/docs while the MCP service remains unreachable.

## MCP Status
- Attempts to call `mcp__game-mcp-server__fetch_handoff`, `list_mcp_resources`, and backlog queries timed out (no response from `game-mcp-server`). Falling back to locally stored handoffs/backlog for this session.

## Summary
- Mirrored the latest RenderOps packet into `deliveries/renderops/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T05-19-21-549Z/`, bundling ZIP, manifests, PACKET_README, and lighting summary for immediate sharing.
- Marked approval job `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/act2-crossroads/2025-11-01T05:19:21.571Z-af361a7d-b05a-46f4-bf06-996e877f3dc5.json` as completed with acknowledgement metadata pointing RenderOps to the staged delivery.
- Regenerated RenderOps approval summaries via `monitorRenderOpsApprovals` so telemetry now reflects zero pending actionable segments.
- Updated backlog and asset inventory docs to capture the staged delivery, completed approval, and ongoing monitoring expectations.

## Deliverables
- `deliveries/renderops/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T05-19-21-549Z/` — staged RenderOps delivery directory (ZIP, manifests, README, lighting summary, staging manifest).
- `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/act2-crossroads/2025-11-01T05:19:21.571Z-af361a7d-b05a-46f4-bf06-996e877f3dc5.json` — approval job updated to `completed` with Codex Session 223 acknowledgement.
- `reports/art/renderops-approval-summary.{json,md}` — refreshed telemetry aggregates showing all jobs acknowledged.
- Documentation: `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` (renderops staging + acknowledgement notes).

## Commands Executed
- `node scripts/art/stageRenderOpsDelivery.js --packet-dir reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T05-19-21-549Z`
- `node scripts/art/monitorRenderOpsApprovals.js --markdown`
- `sha256sum reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T05-19-21-549Z.zip`

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** — Next steps now focus on monitoring bespoke week updates and logging RenderOps feedback; recorded that Session 223 staged the delivery and acknowledged approval job `af361a7d-b05a-46f4-bf06-996e877f3dc5`.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Continue monitoring bespoke tracking for new updates; rerun the automation bundle if RenderOps requests adjustments.
- Watch for incoming RenderOps feedback tied to packet `act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T05-19-21-549Z`; import via `scripts/art/importRenderOpsFeedback.js` if actionable segments appear.
- Re-attempt MCP backlog/handoff sync when `game-mcp-server` responds so remote records reflect Session 223 progress.

## Verification
- `node scripts/art/monitorRenderOpsApprovals.js --markdown` — telemetry regenerated, reports zero pending actionable segments and acknowledges job `af361a7d-b05a-46f4-bf06-996e877f3dc5`.
- No Jest/Playwright suites were rerun; no code changes landed this session (data + documentation updates only).

## Metrics
- RenderOps bundle checksum (ZIP): `93b9a33662a0e41bf4a0c67d980eef1aa88b9fd85f186aa51e3c400f04fd9a47`.
- Approval job acknowledged at `2025-11-01T05:32:10Z` via internal deliveries staging (`deliveries/renderops/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T05-19-21-549Z/`).
