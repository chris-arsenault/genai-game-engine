# Autonomous Development Session #206 – District Tileset Selection Wiring

**Date**: 2025-11-09  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~90m  
**Focus**: Route district generation through the multi-atlas seam catalog so runtime placements tag the correct AR-005 tileset metadata.

## Summary
- Mapped district types and explicit district IDs to their AR-005 tileset attachments, adding resolver hooks so `DistrictGenerator` assigns the correct `activeTilesetId` ahead of TemplateVariantResolver lookups.
- Reapplied catalog metadata when stamping room placements, ensuring seam previews, clusters, and corridor seam painter metrics pull from the active atlas instead of the Neon District default.
- Added Jest coverage that locks atlas selection for mixed/commercial/industrial runs and verifies config overrides, guarding regression of the new mapping logic.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.js`
- `tests/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-005: District Tilesets (M4)** – Marked district-driven `activeTilesetId` selection as complete, recorded the runtime wiring in completed work, and focused next steps on surfacing seam catalog stats inside corridor validation dashboards.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Refreshed the AR-005 entry with the new active tileset wiring summary and narrowed next steps to dashboard instrumentation.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Feed seam catalog stats into corridor validation dashboards so placements surface atlas mismatches automatically.
- Instrument corridor validation dashboards to consume placement metadata (`activeTilesetId`, seam previews) and alert when catalog entries drift from promoted manifests.

## Verification
- `npm test`

## Metrics
- Default resolver now maps `DistrictTypes.MIXED`/`neon_districts` → `image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district`, `DistrictTypes.COMMERCIAL`/`corporate_spires` → `image-ar-005-tileset-corporate-spires`, `DistrictTypes.INDUSTRIAL`/`archive_undercity` → `image-ar-005-tileset-archive-undercity`, with config overrides supporting `image-ar-005-tileset-zenith-sector`.
