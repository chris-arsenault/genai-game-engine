# Autonomous Development Session #222 – RenderOps Bundle Refresh

**Date**: 2025-11-21  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Re-run the art automation regression bundle, package the updated RenderOps delivery, and confirm Memory Parlor quest highlights remain within luminance tolerances.

## Summary
- Replayed the week-one bespoke tracking sweep, updating manifest statuses and reports to reflect five applied updates with refreshed approval metadata.
- Packaged a new Act 2 Crossroads RenderOps bundle (ZIP + manifests + neon glow attachments) and staged the approval queue entry in `ready_for_ack` with checksum and delivery instructions.
- Exported the expanded 15-segment luminance snapshot post-bundle to verify the Memory Parlor quest highlight tier still meets tolerance targets and documented the run across backlog and asset inventory notes.

## Deliverables
- `reports/art/week1-bespoke-progress.json` — refreshed week-one bespoke rollup (5 updates applied; 3 approved, 1 pending, 1 in review).
- `reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T05-19-21-549Z/` & `.zip` — share-ready RenderOps packet with metadata, summary markdown, share/delivery manifests, and neon glow approval attachments.
- `reports/telemetry/renderops-approvals/act2-crossroads/2025-11-01T05:19:21.571Z-af361a7d-b05a-46f4-bf06-996e877f3dc5.json` — queued approval job capturing bundle checksum and delivery instructions (status `ready_for_ack`).
- `reports/art/luminance-snapshots/act2-crossroads/act2-crossroads-luminance-2025-11-01T05-19-26-847Z.{json,md}` — latest 15-segment luminance export confirming all segments remain within tolerance.
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md` — recorded the automation rerun, new RenderOps packet, and updated backlog next steps.

## Commands Executed
- `npm run art:track-bespoke`
- `npm run art:package-renderops`
- `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** (`3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`): Logged the Session 222 automation sweep (bundle refresh, packet/approval staging, luminance snapshot) in `completed_work`, set next steps to share the bundle and ack job `af361a7d-b05a-46f4-bf06-996e877f3dc5`, and noted continued monitoring of bespoke week updates.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Share the RenderOps bundle (`reports/art/renderops-packets/act2-crossroads-2025-11-01T05-19-21-549Z.zip`) with the art ops channel and acknowledge the queued job once delivery is confirmed.
- Monitor bespoke tracking for subsequent week updates and re-run the automation suite if new assets land or RenderOps requests adjustments.

## Verification
- Automation bundle: `npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance` (all completed successfully; RenderOps packet shows 12/12 segments ok and luminance snapshot 15/15 ok).

## Metrics
- Week-one bespoke rollup: updatesApplied=5; statusBreakdown — `bespoke-approved` 3, `bespoke-pending` 1, `bespoke-in-review` 1.
- RenderOps packet: actionableSegments=0; statusCounts — ok 12, skipped 0; ZIP checksum `93b9a33662a0e41bf4a0c67d980eef1aa88b9fd85f186aa51e3c400f04fd9a47`.
- Luminance snapshot: segments evaluated 15; ok 15; Memory Parlor highlights remain within configured tolerances.
