# Autonomous Development Session #218 – Backlog Automation Sweep

**Date**: 2025-11-18  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Normalize backlog statuses around automation-only workflows and refresh documentation/TODOs without delivering new content.

## Summary
- Reframed AR-050 follow-ups around the existing art automation, replacing manual vendor callouts with scripted overlay derivative, analysis, and luminance export commands.
- Marked M1-027 (Code Quality Pass) and QA-202 (SaveManager LocalStorage Regression) as **review-approved**, documenting that ESLint/Jest automation already satisfies their acceptance criteria.
- Trimmed the Next Session Focus TODO list to the Memory Parlor overlay carry-overs and high-priority automation runs so future sessions have a precise, automation-only checklist.

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Updated AR-050 next steps, recorded M1-027/QA-202 review-approved status, and refreshed the Next Session Focus TODO section to reflect automation-driven carry-overs.

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** (`3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`): Next steps now point to `npm run art:generate-crossroads-overlays`, `analyzeCrossroadsOverlays`, and `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`, with notes clarifying the Memory Parlor plate flows solely through automation.
- **M1-027: Code Quality Pass** (`0345d310-20c4-485c-8ae7-6fae9222cd14`): Status set to `review-approved`; linting and Jest coverage enforce the acceptance criteria without additional manual sweeps.
- **QA-202: SaveManager LocalStorage Regression** (`1d5c460a-d0a4-4c6a-9ed0-b27c7caaf519`): Status set to `review-approved`, confirming the regression suite/TestStatus automation already protects the work.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Process `image-memory-parlor-neon-001` through `npm run art:generate-crossroads-overlays -- --filter image-memory-parlor-neon-001` so tiling and alpha metadata export automatically into the manifests.
- Use `node scripts/art/analyzeCrossroadsOverlays.js --dir assets/generated/ar-050` to log Memory Parlor luminance/alpha stats and sync the automation output into `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`.
- Rerun `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance` after wiring the derived overlay files to keep tolerance reports current with the Memory Parlor plate.

## Verification
- No automated suites executed; documentation and backlog updates only.

## Metrics
- Backlog items reclassified to review-approved: 2.
- Documentation files updated: 1.
