# Autonomous Development Session #17 - WorldStateStore Foundation

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.4 hours (07:32Z – 07:54Z)  
**Status**: WorldStateStore plan + Phase 0 scaffolding delivered ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Authored `docs/plans/world-state-store-plan.md`, translating Session #16 research into an actionable architecture with reducers, selectors, performance envelope, and rollout phases.
- Implemented Phase 0 of the hybrid Event-Sourced WorldStateStore (`src/game/state/`), wiring quest/story/faction/tutorial slices to the EventBus and exposing memoized selectors.
- Integrated SaveManager with the new store (storage abstraction + parity validation) and updated the state management benchmark to include the real implementation.
- Added comprehensive unit coverage for slices + store and extended SaveManager specs to cover store snapshots. All tests pass except the existing `LevelSpawnSystem` perf spec, which still exceeds the 50 ms target under CI load (~99 ms observed).

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Architecture Plan**: `docs/plans/world-state-store-plan.md`
- **Store Implementation**: `src/game/state/WorldStateStore.js` + slice modules + memoization utility
- **Save Manager Integration**: storage abstraction + parity guardrails in `SaveManager`
- **Benchmarks**: `benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js` now exercises the production store
- **Tests**: New suites under `tests/game/state/` + expanded `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`
- **Backlog Update**: PO-002 marked In Progress with plan reference in `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test` (fails): `tests/game/systems/LevelSpawnSystem.test.js` performance spec still reports ~99 ms for 200 spawns (threshold 50 ms). All other suites green.
- `node benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js`
  - Redux dispatch mean: **0.0033 ms**
  - ECS mutation mean: **0.0005 ms**
  - WorldStateStore dispatch mean: **0.0025 ms**, selector queries **0.0021 ms**, snapshot **0.1105 ms** (~66.4 KB payload)

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **PO-002 Phase 1** – Wire quest/dialogue/tutorial systems & UI overlays to WorldStateStore selectors; add invariant tests + Playwright quest regression (tracked via PO-003).
2. **SaveManager parity follow-up** – Monitor console parity warnings once live data flows through the store; tighten schema validation for reducer payloads.
3. **LevelSpawnSystem perf test** – Investigate recurring >50 ms spawn time (observed ~99 ms). Validate whether regression is environmental or due to recent changes; adjust threshold or optimize spawning path.
4. **Quest Debug HUD tooling** – Not yet started; recommended once selectors power UI to maintain observability momentum.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Migrate quest log + tracker UI to consume store selectors; retire legacy event listeners (PO-003).
2. Backfill Jest invariants comparing QuestManager/StoryFlagManager state to store snapshots.
3. Profile LevelSpawnSystem spawn loop; capture perf trace to justify threshold update or optimization.
4. Draft developer-facing store usage notes (docs/tech) once UI integration stabilizes.

---

## Session Metrics
- **Files Added**: 6 (plan + state modules + tests)
- **Files Modified**: 6 (Game.js, QuestManager.js, SaveManager.js, backlog, benchmark, SaveManager tests)
- **Tests Added**: 5 unit suites (`tests/game/state/*`, SaveManager extensions)
- **Benchmarks Run**: 1 (state-store-prototype)
- **Known Failures**: LevelSpawnSystem perf spec (>50 ms)

## Timestamps
- **Start**: 2025-10-28T07:32:00Z
- **End**: 2025-10-28T07:54:48Z
- **Elapsed**: ~22 minutes

> Shorter session due to focused architecture + implementation cycle; remaining backlog captured above for continuity.
