# Autonomous Development Session #145 – FX Runtime Guardrails & HUD Coverage

**Date**: October 30, 2025  \
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  \
**Duration**: ~1h 20m  \
**Focus**: Harden particle runtime throughput, extend FX cue coverage to remaining HUD overlays, and automate FX metrics HUD validation.

---

## Summary
- Added load-aware throttling to `ParticleEmitterRuntime`, preventing high-intensity bursts from exceeding global particle budgets while maintaining pooled reuse.
- Wired SaveInspector and ControlBindings overlays into the FX cue pipeline, updating coordinator/bridge/preset tables and locking behaviour with new Jest coverage.
- Delivered responsive FX metrics HUD improvements and a dedicated Playwright scenario that validates live sampling, warning banners, and overlay focus behaviour across layout widths.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/fx/ParticleEmitterRuntime.js`
- `tests/game/fx/ParticleEmitterRuntime.test.js`
- `src/game/fx/FxCueCoordinator.js`
- `src/game/fx/CompositeCueParticleBridge.js`
- `src/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.js`
- `tests/game/ui/SaveInspectorOverlay.fx.test.js`
- `src/game/ui/ControlBindingsOverlay.js`
- `tests/game/ui/ControlBindingsOverlay.test.js`
- `index.html`
- `tests/e2e/debug-overlay-fx-metrics.spec.js`
- Documentation: `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:e2e`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Re-run particle runtime stress tests once bespoke particle sheets arrive to confirm new throttling thresholds remain appropriate under final art loads.
2. Monitor the new FX metrics Playwright scenario for flaky behaviour under CI load; consider gating it behind a focused tag if run times regress.
3. Continue auditing remaining overlays (e.g., TutorialOverlay, SaveInspector detail panels) for optional cue hooks during future polish passes if narrative/UI teams surface additional needs.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated MCP backlog items `FX-240`, `DEBUG-275`, and `FX-239` with new completed work, validation notes, and test references.
- Added "Session #145 Backlog Updates" section to `docs/plans/backlog.md` summarising runtime guardrails, HUD automation, and overlay cue extensions.

---

## Notes
- Particle throttle metrics surfaced via `getStats()` (`throttledSpawns`, `suppressedEmitters`) provide quick insight during future profiling sessions.
- FX metrics HUD grid now uses `auto-fit` columns with a 140px minimum track width, keeping readouts legible down to 200px overlays without stealing focus from the game canvas.
- ControlBindings overlay FX cues align with existing QA telemetry, so future cue identifiers should reuse the established naming convention (`controlBindings*`).
