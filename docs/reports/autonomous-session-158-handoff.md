# Autonomous Development Session #158 – Save/Load QA Prep

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 05m  
**Focus**: Stabilise save/load parity, automate QA packet generation, and exercise autosave under stress.

## Summary
- Normalised SaveManager parity checks by harvesting tutorial skip state and comparing story/quest/faction payloads via lightweight summaries, eliminating false warnings between world snapshots and legacy collectors.
- Added a sustained autosave stress harness inside `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js` to ensure repeated quest completions keep the overlay focused and never emit `game:save_failed`.
- Introduced the save/load QA packet workflow (`scripts/telemetry/packageSaveLoadQa.js`, `src/game/tools/SaveLoadQAPacketBuilder.js`) which bundles latency and payload summaries into timestamped parcels under `reports/telemetry/save-load-qa/`.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/managers/SaveManager.js` parity refinements with new tutorial state helpers, story/quest/faction summarizers, and stable deep comparison.
- `scripts/telemetry/lib/saveManagerFixtures.js`, `scripts/telemetry/profileSaveLoadLatency.js`, `scripts/telemetry/exportSavePayloadSummary.js`, and `scripts/telemetry/packageSaveLoadQa.js` for reusable fixtures plus the QA packaging CLI.
- `src/game/tools/SaveLoadQAPacketBuilder.js` and accompanying unit test `tests/game/tools/SaveLoadQAPacketBuilder.test.js`.
- Autosave stress regression in `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`.
- Fresh QA packet: `reports/telemetry/save-load-qa/save-load-2025-10-31T04-07-26-033Z/` (with zipped twin).
- Backlog doc updated at `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session #158 entry for M3-016).

## Verification
- `npm test -- SaveManager`
- `npm test -- SaveLoadQAPacketBuilder`
- `npm run telemetry:package-save-load -- --iterations=2 --no-samples`

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Share the latest `reports/telemetry/save-load-qa` packet with QA for schema sign-off and capture any requested adjustments. *(M3-016)*
2. Exercise the new autosave stress harness inside the playable build to confirm overlay cues/FX sequencing remains stable under heavy save churn. *(M3-016 / M3-017)*
3. Continue tracking AR-003 & AR-050 asset sourcing once Save/Load follow-ups land; no status change this session. *(AR-003 / AR-050)*

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- Updated MCP backlog item **M3-016** with Session 158 parity/QA automation progress and refreshed next steps.
- Documented the new QA packaging flow in `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session #158 notes, verification commands, and packet location).
- Latest QA packet artefacts staged under `reports/telemetry/save-load-qa/save-load-2025-10-31T04-07-26-033Z/` for distribution.
