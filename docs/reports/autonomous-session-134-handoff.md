# Autonomous Development Session #134 – Control Overlay UX Telemetry

**Date**: November 4, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~1h 45m  
**Focus**: Instrument control bindings overlay navigation for qualitative UX playtests and deliver reporting tooling.

---

## Summary
- Extended `ControlBindingsOverlay` with rich navigation telemetry events (`CONTROL_BINDINGS_NAV_EVENT`), covering selection moves, paging, list mode changes, and remap flows with contextual metadata.
- Introduced `ControlBindingsObservationLog` plus `Game` accessors/export helpers so QA and UX leads can pull structured summaries directly from runtime sessions.
- Shipped `scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.js` to convert recorded logs into JSON/Markdown reports with heuristic recommendations; backed by Jest coverage alongside overlay/unit tests.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/ui/ControlBindingsOverlay.js`: Navigation telemetry emission for selection, paging, list mode changes, capture flow, and binding updates (with metadata).
- `src/game/Game.js`: Observation log wiring, event subscriptions, and export/reset APIs for control bindings sessions.
- `src/game/telemetry/ControlBindingsObservationLog.js`: New telemetry log aggregator with summary generation utilities.
- `scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.js`: CLI exporter producing UX observation summaries (JSON/Markdown) with recommendations.
- Tests: `tests/game/ui/ControlBindingsOverlay.test.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/ControlBindingsObservationLog.test.js`, `tests/scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.test.js`.
- Docs: `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session #134), `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/ui/ControlBindingsOverlay.test.js tests/game/telemetry/ControlBindingsObservationLog.test.js tests/scripts/ux/exportControlBindingsObservations.test.js`
- `npm test`

---

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. `UX-410`: Schedule and run at least three micro-playtests using the new logging/exporter pipeline; synthesize qualitative findings and flag follow-up UI adjustments.

---

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- MCP backlog item `UX-410` moved **In Progress** with notes on telemetry/tooling work and refreshed next steps.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` now includes Session #134 update capturing telemetry + exporter delivery and future playtest actions.
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` logs the new control overlay telemetry + exporter tooling under Unreleased additions.

---

## Notes
- Exporter recommendations currently flag excessive blocked navigation, absent list-mode switching, and incomplete remap flows—tune heuristics after real playtests land.
- Observation log retains the most recent 1,000 events; adjust constructor if longer sessions are expected.
