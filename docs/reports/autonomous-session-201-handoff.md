# Autonomous Development Session #201 – Neon District Seam Metadata Promotion

**Date**: 2025-11-04  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Automate promotion of Neon District seam analysis warnings into authored metadata and sync documentation/backlog for AR-005.

## Summary
- Authored `scripts/art/promoteTilesetSeams.js`, a reusable CLI that converts `analyzeTilesetSeams` reports into seam metadata manifests for downstream tooling.
- Generated `assets/manifests/tilesets/image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district-metadata.json`, capturing all 108 Neon District door seam annotations with orientation tags and collision suggestions.
- Added Jest coverage (`tests/scripts/promoteTilesetSeams.test.js`) to lock the promotion workflow and prevent regressions in future seam conversions.
- Updated asset inventory/backlog docs to reflect the new seam manifest and refocused follow-up work on integrating the metadata and extending the workflow to remaining AR-005 atlases.

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-005: District Tilesets** – Logged the new seam promotion automation in completed work, refreshed `next_steps` to cover manifest integration plus future atlas analysis, and retained monitoring of the queued generation requests.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md` – Marked Neon District seam metadata as delivered and recorded the promotion command/output path.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Refreshed AR-005 status/next steps to point at the new metadata manifest and upcoming integration tasks.
- `assets/manifests/tilesets/image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district-metadata.json` – New seam metadata manifest sourced from the analyzer output.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Integrate the Neon District seam manifest with the tileset preview pipeline and corridor validation tooling, ensuring the metadata is exercised before enabling previews.
- Run `scripts/art/promoteTilesetSeams.js` on Corporate Spires, Archive Undercity, and Zenith Sector once their analysis reports exist, keeping manifests in `assets/manifests/tilesets/`.
- Maintain the AR-050 automation cadence: execute `npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2` and `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance` on 2025-11-07 to capture the scheduled packet.
- Progress Act 3 narrative planning in parallel sessions while honoring the performance work freeze.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/scripts/promoteTilesetSeams.test.js`

## Metrics
- WIP items: 2 (`AR-050` in progress, `AR-005` in progress); performance-tagged backlog remains frozen per Session 200 directive.
