# Autonomous Development Session #224 – Act 3 Finale Art Validation

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~60m  
**Focus**: Confirm finale asset manifests are free of `/assets/` prefixes and extend E2E coverage so every stance surfaces the correct Act 3 finale artwork.

## MCP Status
- `game-mcp-server` responded normally; fetched Session 222 handoff context, refreshed backlog priorities, and recorded new progress for **Act 3 Narrative**.

## Summary
- Audited finale cinematic manifest data and runtime asset plumbing to ensure no lingering `/assets/` URL prefixes remain, keeping Vite publicDir warnings suppressed.
- Refactored `tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js` to drive opposition, support, and alternative finales, asserting overlay/controller asset summaries point to the stance-specific hero and beat artwork.
- Synced backlog item `Act 3 Narrative` and `docs/plans/backlog.md` with the new coverage work plus follow-up validation targets.

## Deliverables
- `tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js` — parameterised Act 3 finale Playwright flow validating stance-specific hero/beat art descriptors and controller summaries.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Session 224 entry capturing the manifest audit, expanded coverage, and refreshed next steps for Act 3 Narrative.

## Commands Executed
- `rg --fixed-strings '"/assets/'`
- `./run_playwright.sh test tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`): Logged Session 224 coverage expansion, noted the manifest audit result, and reset next steps toward audio validation and save/load continuity checks.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Re-run the finale cinematic E2E once the adaptive audio mix lands to validate mood transitions and telemetry hand-offs.
- Smoke test Act 3 finale save/load continuity to ensure stance-specific art descriptors persist across sessions.

## Verification
- `./run_playwright.sh test tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js` — all three stance-specific runs passed (1 worker, no retries).

## Metrics
- Playwright spec `tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`: 3 tests passed (opposition/support/alternative branches) in 4.0 s; each run emitted a single `narrative:finale_cinematic_ready` event and verified hero/beat descriptor integrity.
