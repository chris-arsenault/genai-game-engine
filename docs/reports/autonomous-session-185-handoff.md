# Autonomous Development Session #185 – Kira Locomotion Verification

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Validate bespoke Kira locomotion integration through automated traversal/overlay smoke tests and synchronize backlog/docs.

## Summary
- Executed targeted Playwright traversal/overlay smokes against the bespoke-normalized Kira atlas; both `district-travel-traversal` and `feedback-overlays` suites passed without animation or overlay regressions.
- Re-ran PlayerAnimationSystem Jest coverage to spot-check dash/slide loop behavior with the regenerated `kiraAnimationConfig` manifest; tests green.
- Cleared AR-003 follow-up by updating backlog notes/next steps and reflecting the "Ready for Review" status in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

## Backlog Adjustments
- **AR-003** (Player Character Sprite) `next_steps` cleared after successful Playwright/Jest verification; notes capture the automation run results.
- No status changes for AR-050 or M3-016; WIP count remains 3 (AR-003 `ready-for-review`, AR-050 `in-progress`, M3-016 `in-progress`).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. AR-003 – Await narrative/art review sign-off; no further automation required unless regressions appear.
2. M3-016 – Hold distribution of the refreshed save/load QA packet until analytics acknowledges the baseline (`npm run telemetry:distribute-save-load`).
3. AR-050 – Resume bespoke tracking automation once save/load parity dependencies unblock (unchanged).
4. AR-008 / QUEST-610 / UX-410 – Still blocked on audio stem delivery, RenderOps validation, and automated UX guidance respectively.

## Verification
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/district-travel-traversal.spec.js
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/feedback-overlays.spec.js
npm test   # Jest suite completed (203/203 passing) before CLI timeout at ~13.2s
npx jest --runInBand tests/game/systems/PlayerAnimationSystem.test.js
```

## Artifacts Updated
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `playwright-results.xml`
- MCP backlog item AR-003 (`2c096978-0bea-4d5b-a39a-7f09a27211af`)
