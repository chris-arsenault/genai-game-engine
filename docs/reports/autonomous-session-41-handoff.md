# Autonomous Development Session #41 – Scrambler Firewall Integration

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0h15m (Start 2025-10-28T17:43:59-07:00 – End 2025-10-28T17:58:36-07:00)  
**Status**: Scrambler firewall system landed; infiltration gating enforced and covered with unit tests.

---

## Executive Summary
- Introduced `FirewallScramblerSystem` to convert Cipher scrambler charges into timed firewall bypass events, world-state flags, and inventory consumption.
- Updated `DisguiseSystem`, `QuestManager`, and Act 1 Memory Parlor quest data so infiltration requires an active scrambler window and benefits from reduced detection odds.
- Added Jest coverage validating scrambler activation, quest gating, and disguise modifiers; documentation refreshed to reflect the mechanical integration.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Firewall Scrambler System**: New ECS system consumes scrambler charges, emits activation/expiry events, updates story flags, and coordinates cooldown handling (`src/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.js`, `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- **Disguise & Quest Integration**: Disguise detection now listens for scrambler events while `QuestManager` enforces Memory Parlor objective requirements via story flags and new requirement evaluation (`src/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.js`, `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js`).
- **Quest Data & Metadata**: Memory Parlor infiltration objective now demands `cipher_scrambler_access` and an active scrambler flag; quest metadata documents firewall expectations for future scenes (`src/game/data/quests/act1Quests.js`).
- **Documentation & Decision Log**: Changelog, quartermaster brief, and backlog note the new mechanics; architecture decision recorded for the firewall scrambler approach (`docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/narrative/characters/cipher-quartermaster.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`).
- **Automated Coverage**: Added Jest suites for the scrambler system, disguise modifiers, and quest gating to guard the new behaviour (`tests/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.scrambler.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js`).

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js tests/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.scrambler.test.js tests/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.test.js`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Runtime Validation Pending**: Need a Playwright or manual runtime sweep once the Memory Parlor scene exists to confirm the new firewall events line up with actual level geometry.
2. **Infiltration Scene Authoring**: `memory_parlor_firewall` and related trigger volumes are still theoretical; scene work must create the gate entity so the new system can fire in-game.
3. **Profiling Follow-up**: Performance benchmarks still only cover engine workloads; schedule vendor-heavy profiling pass after the infiltration scene is playable.
4. **Session Duration**: Work loop under 4h due to automation window—flagged for the next agent to continue polishing infiltration beats and QA coverage without delay.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Build the Memory Parlor infiltration scene (firewall trigger, stealth layout) that consumes the scrambler events.
2. Extend Playwright coverage to walk the infiltration objective and assert detection modifiers / blocked messaging.
3. Run broader Jest + Playwright regression plus profiling harness once the scene is wired up.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 13 existing files updated, 3 new files added.
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 3 Jest suites exercising scrambler activation, quest gating, and disguise modifiers.
- **Verification Commands**: Targeted Jest run (command above).
- **Architecture Logs**: Decision `Introduce FirewallScramblerSystem for Memory Parlor infiltration` stored in MCP.

---

## Notes
- Scrambler activation and quest gating now rely on story flags (`cipher_scrambler_access`, `cipher_scrambler_active`); any manual state fiddling should route through the new system to stay consistent with world state snapshots.
- Inventory events remain the single source for charge consumption—avoid bypassing `inventory:item_updated` when granting or removing scrambler charges.
