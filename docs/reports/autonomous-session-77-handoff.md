# Autonomous Development Session #77 – Adaptive Audio Orchestration & Trigger Schema
**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h50m  
**Status**: AdaptiveMusic now runs through the main game loop, trigger authoring has a formal schema, and procedural districts support rotated rooms with corridor validation.

---

## Highlights
- Registered `TriggerSystem` in the live game, layered Trigger components on Memory Parlor/quest zones, and captured the process in a standalone authoring guide.
- Hooked `AdaptiveMusic` into the `Game` coordinator so gameplay systems drive moods through EventBus helpers with timed reverts handled centrally.
- Extended `DistrictGenerator` and corridor placement to respect rotated room bounds, adding fresh regression coverage for rotated layouts.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/Game.js`, `tests/game/audio/GameAudioTelemetry.test.js` – Shared AdaptiveMusic orchestration and adaptive mood event handlers.
- `src/game/audio/AmbientSceneAudioController.js`, `src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js`, `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`, `src/game/systems/QuestSystem.js`, `tests/game/systems/QuestSystem.trigger.test.js` – Trigger authoring schema, quest trigger wiring, and coverage.
- `src/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.js`, `tests/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.test.js`, `tests/engine/procedural/RoomInstance.test.js` – Rotation-aware placement and corridor validation.
- Docs: `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md`, updates to `docs/plans/audio-system-plan.md`, `docs/guides/procedural-generation-integration.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/audio/AmbientSceneAudioController.test.js tests/game/audio/GameAudioTelemetry.test.js tests/game/systems/QuestSystem.trigger.test.js tests/game/procedural/DistrictGenerator.test.js tests/engine/procedural/RoomInstance.test.js tests/engine/audio/AdaptiveMusic.test.js`

All suites passed locally.

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Gameplay emitters for adaptive moods** – Disguise/combat systems still need to raise `audio:adaptive:set_mood` events so the new orchestration sees real gameplay stimuli.
2. **Quest trigger migration** – Additional legacy triggers (Act 1 crime scene, vendor interactions) should be refit with the new Trigger schema to consolidate authoring.
3. **Tilemap rotation fidelity** – Layout rotation currently uses bounding boxes; rotating the underlying tilemaps remains a follow-up to avoid visual mismatches for asymmetrical templates.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Wire Disguise/Firewall scrambler events to the adaptive mood helper and validate mood decay timing in-game.
- Continue migrating quest/area triggers (crime scene, Act 1 vendors) to the documented schema and add sanity tests.
- Investigate tilemap rotation or template variants so rotated rooms present correctly and corridor seams can host actual door tiles.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Created and closed `AUDIO-512: AdaptiveMusic Game Loop Orchestration`, `PHYS-206: Trigger Authoring Schema Integration`, and `PROC-119: Rotated Room Placement Support` with structured notes and acceptance criteria.
- Backlog markdown reflects new items under **Session #77 Backlog Updates**; changelog updated in Unreleased > Added.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Authored `docs/tech/trigger-authoring.md` to document the trigger schema and event flow.
- Adaptive music telemetry snapshots remain bounded (<8 entries) after switching to EventBus-driven mood transitions.
- Procedural district tests confirm corridor endpoints stay within rotated room bounds.
