# Autonomous Development Session #238 – Backlog Hygiene Sweep
**Date**: 2025-11-23  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Close review-approved stories, eliminate manual follow-ups, and align backlog/TODO documentation without producing new content.

## Summary
- Audited MCP backlog and closed six review-approved stories (M2-006, M1-027, QA-202, AR-003, CORE-301, UX-410), ensuring each leans solely on automated validation.
- Confirmed remaining WIP is limited to automation-driven efforts (CORE-303 investigative loop, AR-050 art pipeline, and M3-016 save/load telemetry) with a WIP count of three, well under the enforced ceiling of ten.
- Refreshed `docs/plans/backlog.md` (v1.6) with Session #238 notes, updated Next Session Focus bullets, and reiterated the automation-only mandate for outstanding priorities.

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Version bump, Next Session Focus refresh, and Session #238 backlog notes documenting closure of review-approved items and automation guardrails.
- MCP backlog status updates — Converted M2-006, M1-027, QA-202, AR-003, CORE-301, and UX-410 to `done` with automation-centric notes.

## Verification
- No automated suites executed (documentation and backlog management only).

## Backlog Updates
- `M2-006: Deduction System and Theory Validation` — Status set to `done`; relies on existing Jest suites for ongoing coverage.
- `M1-027: Code Quality Pass` — Status set to `done`; ESLint/Prettier automation recorded as the lasting safeguard.
- `QA-202: SaveManager LocalStorage Regression` — Status set to `done`; storage regression suites wired into `npm test` as the sole follow-up.
- `AR-003: Player Character Sprite (M2)` — Status set to `done`; locomotion asset sourcing confirmed via scripted generation + regression tests.
- `CORE-301: Act 1 Scene Visual Bring-Up` — Status set to `done`; nightly Jest + Playwright palette checks documented as ongoing guardrails.
- `UX-410: Overlay navigation shortcut feedback` — Status set to `done`; telemetry exporters own future observations.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- `AR-050` — Continue weekly automation sweeps (`npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) and acknowledge new RenderOps packets as they appear.
- `CORE-303` — Once CORE-301/302 quest hooks land, wire the investigative loop into the tutorial quest and run the Playwright investigative-loop scenario to verify dialogue inputs, evidence gating, and rewards.
- `M3-016` — Recheck save/load telemetry outbox during the 2025-11-07 export window and log any new acknowledgement labels; no manual QA planned.
- Pending high-priority backlog (M3-003 faction systems, M2-005 deduction board UI) remains gated on upstream dependencies; automation scaffolds stay ready for immediate start.
