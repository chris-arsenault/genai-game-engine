# Autonomous Development Session #96 - Crossroads Art Pipeline & Branch Dialogue Hooks  
**Date**: November 11, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h15m  
**Status**: Crossroads hub prepared for art drop-in, Act 2 branch objectives now drive remote ops dialogue, and telemetry validation harness guards QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge payloads.

---

## Highlights
- Added configurable art override pipeline for the Act 2 Crossroads hub, including safe fallbacks and asset preloading hooks.
- Registered Act 2 branch objective dialogue trees and wired area triggers in the corporate, resistance, and personal interiors to emit `interaction:dialogue` events.
- Introduced `QuestTelemetryValidationHarness` with regression coverage to validate `QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge` emissions and catch schema/duplicate issues early.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.js` – resolves geometry from `GameConfig.sceneArt`, primes optional art assets, and preserves metadata for analytics.
- `src/game/config/GameConfig.js` – added `sceneArt.act2Crossroads` override slot for upcoming art bundle.
- `src/game/data/dialogues/Act2BranchObjectiveDialogues.js`, `src/game/Game.js` – new dialogue trees for Act 2 branch objectives registered at startup.
- `src/game/scenes/Act2CorporateInfiltrationScene.js`, `Act2ResistanceHideoutScene.js`, `Act2PersonalInvestigationScene.js` – trigger metadata now references dialogue IDs and emits dialogue events on area entry.
- `src/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.js` – reusable telemetry validator bridging to analytics QA.
- Tests: `tests/game/scenes/Act2BranchObjectiveDialogues.test.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.test.js`, updated `tests/game/telemetry/QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge.test.js`.
- Docs: updated `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.layout.test.js tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.triggers.test.js tests/game/scenes/Act2CrossroadsScene.prompts.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2BranchObjectiveDialogues.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetryValidationHarness.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/QuestTriggerTelemetryBridge.test.js`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Crossroads art/navigation package** – Await delivery; once received, populate `GameConfig.sceneArt.act2Crossroads`, drop assets, and rerun hub layout/navigation suites.
2. **Narrative/dialogue polish** – Review newly scripted Act 2 objective dialogue with the narrative team for copy/VO nuances and update docs accordingly.
3. **Telemetry dashboards** – Use the new validation harness against live analytics dashboards after the warehouse refresh to confirm tagging alignment.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Import the Crossroads art bundle via the new overrides, confirm canvas integration, and rerun scene/layout tests.
- Conduct narrative QA on branch objective dialogue flows; capture any copy polish or UI follow-ups.
- Connect the telemetry validation harness to the analytics dashboards and adjust schemas if discrepancies surface.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated `QUEST-610` with Session 96 progress (art override pipeline, branch dialogues, telemetry harness) and refreshed next steps to reflect the new tooling.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the current MCP priorities and highlights the telemetry harness in next-session focus.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- New dialogue IDs: `dialogue_act2_*` for projection analysis, shadow broadcast, encryption clone, exfiltration, coordination, and signal array beats; all registered via `Act2BranchObjectiveDialogues`.
- Telemetry validation harness tracks required fields (`source`, `telemetryTag`, `questId`, `objectiveId`) and flags duplicates using event + tag + trigger keys.
- Crossroads geometry now loads overrides lazily (AssetLoader with safe fallback), preserving 60 FPS goals while waiting for final art.
