# Autonomous Development Session #228 – Backlog Hygiene & Automation Sync

**Date**: 2025-11-21  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~40m  
**Focus**: Clean backlog/state artifacts, retire manual follow-ups, and refresh documentation/TODOs without shipping new content.

## Summary
- Removed manual follow-ups from AR-050, BUG-201, and QA-330 so each story now leans entirely on scripted automation (art pipeline, collision guards, Playwright bootstrap).
- Rebuilt the high-priority backlog table and Next Session Focus checklist around Act 3 finale integration, RenderOps automation, and investigative loop planning.
- Cleared the stale `playwright-results.xml` artifact to keep the workspace limited to reproducible outputs.

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — Version bumped to 1.5, updated high-priority table/Next Session Focus, and logged Session 228 maintenance notes.
- `playwright-results.xml` — Removed generated artifact (no longer tracked).

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** (`3a418093-4f74-4da5-a384-07086f24c555`): Next steps now reference only automation commands `npm run art:stage-renderops`, `npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, and `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance` to close the pending RenderOps job with zero manual handoffs.
- **BUG-201: Collision system handles null colliders on NPC load** (`7a756a6d-ae5b-49b1-b1bd-a487ffdd1eef`): Cleared residual manual monitoring from `next_steps` and documented that automated Jest suites cover the regression.
- **QA-330: Stabilize Tutorial Overlay Playwright Bootstrap** (`522ea727-93a8-41ce-b0a7-05f347645a1e`): Removed leftover manual troubleshooting bullets and affirmed scripted Playwright cadence in the notes.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Integrate the shared Act 3 memory well overlay into FinaleCinematicOverlay and cover the beat with `npm test` plus `npx playwright test tests/e2e/finale-cinematic.spec.js`.
- Re-run the art automation bundle (`npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) to close RenderOps job `af361a7d-b05a-46f4-bf06-996e877f3dc5`.
- Decompose CORE-303 investigative loop tasks once CORE-301/302 dependencies are ready, ensuring future work remains automation-first.

## Verification
- No automated suites executed; backlog/doc cleanup only.

## Metrics
- Backlog items normalized for automation-only workflows: 3.
- Documentation files updated: 1.
- Generated artifacts removed: 1.
