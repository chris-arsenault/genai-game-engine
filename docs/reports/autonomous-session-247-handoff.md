# Autonomous Development Session #247 – Asset Pipeline Sync
**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Clear legacy bespoke asset statuses and refresh the Neon District tileset via automation.

## Summary
- Regenerated the AR-005 Neon District tileset (v3) with GPT-Image-1, capturing deeper wet-surface reflections and expanded holographic signage while archiving the prior atlas for reference.
- Normalized AR-001 deduction board UI entries and the AR-002 generic evidence marker to `ai-generated` status, removing residual bespoke queue metadata from `assets/images/requests.json`.
- Synced documentation (`docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`) and the MCP backlog item for AR-050 to reflect the new asset pass and manifest cleanup.

## Deliverables
- `assets/generated/images/ar-005/image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district.png`
- `assets/generated/images/ar-005/image-ar-005-tileset-neon-district-v2.png`
- `assets/images/requests.json`
- `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

## Verification
- No automated test suites were run (asset sourcing & manifest sync only).

## Backlog Updates
- **AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline** – logged the regenerated Neon District tileset and manifest normalization in MCP, leaving existing automation follow-ups intact.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Schedule the expanded CORE-303 investigative loop Playwright spec alongside the tutorial overlay smoke suite for the next nightly run.
- Profile deduction board overlay responsiveness once the refreshed art bundle is integrated to ensure drag/drop latency stays under 16 ms (M2-005 follow-up).
- Continue the AR-050 visual pipeline weekly automation sweeps (`npm run art:track-bespoke`, `npm run art:package-renderops`, `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) and track RenderOps acknowledgements.
- Keep the M3-003 faction ECS scaffolding staged until upstream data contracts finalize, noting dependencies as they appear.
- Integrate the camera bounds into level/scene loading so `setBounds` receives authoritative world dimensions during runtime scene activation.
