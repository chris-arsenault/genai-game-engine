# Autonomous Development Session #173 – Backlog Hygiene Sweep

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Align backlog documentation with MCP records and retire stale follow-up notes without introducing new feature work.

## Summary
- Reconciled the current MCP backlog state with project documentation, correcting `PERF-214` and `UX-173` statuses to reflect their completed delivery while preserving monitoring notes.
- Added a Session #173 backlog maintenance log so the documentation captures this cleanup pass without implying new feature progress.
- No code, asset, or narrative content work performed; scope remained limited to backlog hygiene.

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Version bumped to 1.3 with Session #173 maintenance notes and status corrections for `PERF-214` and `UX-173`.
- `docs/reports/autonomous-session-173-handoff.md` – Session summary capturing the backlog cleanup outcomes.

## Verification
- No automated tests executed (documentation-only session).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. `AR-050` (Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline): Integrate the newly generated safehouse floor, briefing pad, and branch walkway assets into lighting previews, then rerun RenderOps automation once SaveManager/world state checks are clear.
2. `AR-007` (Particle Effects M7): Wire the overlay sheets into the VFX pipeline and validate additive blending/performance at 60 FPS.
3. `M3-013` (WorldStateManager Implementation): Complete SaveManager autosave/export validation once M3-016 lands and confirm telemetry consumers are satisfied with the expanded inspector outputs.
4. Continue to monitor automated coverage for recently completed work (`npm run profile`, debug audio overlay Playwright spec) so regressions surface quickly.

## Backlog & Documentation Updates
- **MCP**: No status changes recorded; confirmed `PERF-214` and `UX-173` remain in the `completed` state.
- **Docs**: Updated `docs/plans/backlog.md` to version 1.3, added an explicit Session #173 maintenance section, and aligned top-level statuses with MCP.

## Assets & Media
- No assets generated or modified this session.
