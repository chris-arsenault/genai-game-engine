# Autonomous Development Session #198 – Backlog Automation Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-11-03  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Align backlog next steps with automation-only workflows, approve queued review items, and remove generated artifacts left in the workspace.

## Summary
- Marked `M2-006: Deduction System and Theory Validation` as **review-approved** after confirming automated Jest coverage satisfies all acceptance criteria; documented the new status in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- Rewrote `AR-050`, `AR-005`, and `M2-020` backlog next steps to reference the existing CLI/Node automation scripts (`art:track-bespoke`, `art:export-crossroads-luminance`, `scripts/art/queueGenerationRequests.js`, `npm run benchmark:layout-graph`, etc.), eliminating manual monitoring language across MCP and markdown.
- Refreshed `docs/plans/backlog.md` (including the **Next Session Focus** TODO list) so outstanding work mirrors the latest MCP records and prioritises the automation-driven follow-ups from grooming.
- Cleared residual generated artifacts (`playwright-report/`, `coverage/`, `test-results/`) to keep the repository free of stale build/test outputs.

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Updated statuses, next steps, and TODO bullets to reflect automation-only workflows and the review-approved M2-006 state.
- Removed transient directories: `playwright-report/`, `coverage/`, `test-results/` (all regenerated outputs outside version control).

## Verification
- No automated tests executed (documentation/backlog maintenance only).

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Queue the remaining AR-005 tilesets via `node scripts/art/queueGenerationRequests.js --filter=image-ar-005-tileset-corporate-spires,image-ar-005-tileset-archive-undercity,image-ar-005-tileset-zenith-sector` and resync manifests once GPT runs complete.
2. Stage the Neon District tile integration check by preparing seam/collision automation; defer manual reviews until the scripted hooks are available.
3. Execute the 2025-11-07 AR-050 bespoke sweep (`npm run art:track-bespoke -- --week=2` → `npm run art:export-crossroads-luminance`) and archive the generated tolerance report/approval summary.
4. Continue scripted LayoutGraph benchmarking (`npm run benchmark:layout-graph`) and investigation profiling (`npm run profile -- --scenario=investigation`) to monitor the M2-020 regression follow-up.

## Backlog & Coordination
- `M2-006` now sits in **review-approved**, reducing active WIP to AR-050, AR-005, and M2-020.
- Updated MCP next steps for AR-050, AR-005, and M2-020 to point at automation scripts; notes emphasise the removal of manual monitoring/spot-checks.
- Markdown backlog mirrors MCP status, and the TODO list highlights the carried-over asset generation plus the top-priority automation sweeps.
- Generated artifact cleanup complete; no additional documentation or asset changes required this session.
