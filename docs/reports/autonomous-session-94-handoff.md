# Autonomous Development Session #94 - Personal Archive Bring-Up  
**Date**: November 9, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h20m  
**Status**: All three Act 2 branch interiors now exist with quest scaffolding and loader coverage; art/nav integration and deeper quest beats remain.  

---

## Highlights
- Authored `loadAct2PersonalInvestigationScene` with registry-backed triggers, navigation mesh metadata, and geometry for the personal archive interior, mirroring the corporate/resistance structure.
- Introduced `act2PersonalInvestigationQuest` scaffolding, registered it alongside the other Act 2 thread quests, and routed the personal branch through the loader/config registry.
- Extended Jest coverage for the new scene (`Act2PersonalInvestigationScene.test.js`) and branch transitions (`Game.act2ThreadScene.test.js`), and expanded designer docs with the personal trigger map.

---

## Deliverables
- `src/game/scenes/Act2PersonalInvestigationScene.js`
- `src/game/data/quests/act2PersonalInvestigationQuest.js`
- `src/game/Game.js`
- `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`
- `tests/game/scenes/Act2PersonalInvestigationScene.test.js`
- `tests/game/Game.act2ThreadScene.test.js`
- `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2PersonalInvestigationScene.test.js tests/game/Game.act2ThreadScene.test.js`
  - Confirms trigger wiring, quest metadata, and loader transitions across all three branches.
- Full suite still surfaces the intermittent `BSPGenerator` perf flake; monitor but no new regressions observed today.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Crossroads art/navigation package** — Awaiting external drop. Once assets land, integrate and re-run navigation/loader suites to ensure mesh fidelity across interiors.
2. **Act 2 quest depth** — NeuroSync and Archivist branches need expanded objectives/dialogue; personal branch will need follow-up beats after vault access.
3. **Procedural perf guard** — Continue monitoring the `BSPGenerator` <10 ms assertion; profile or adjust thresholds if variance grows.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Integrate and validate the Crossroads art/navigation bundle across all Act 2 scenes.
- Expand Act 2 quest/dialogue beats so each branch progresses beyond scaffolding, including personal follow-ups after the memory vault.
- Audit analytics hooks to ensure new telemetry tags feed dashboards correctly once additional content is layered in.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated MCP backlog item `QUEST-610` with personal branch delivery, refreshed next steps, and linked new regression coverage.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the MCP record with Session 94 progress.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Personal archive navigation mesh ships nodes `archive_entry`, `casefile_desk`, and `memory_vault` for `NavigationMeshService` consumers; metadata tags (`memory_archive`, `memory_projection`) surface to analytics/UI.
- Trigger metadata exposes `memory_threads` and `testimony_projection` hooks for knowledge ledger and narrative overlays; telemetry tags (`act2_personal_*`) are now documented for analytics alignment.
