# Autonomous Development Session #179 – Dash/Slide Atlas Normalization

**Date**: 2025-10-31  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~45m  
**Focus**: Unblock M3-016 by normalizing the generated dash/slide atlas, merge it into the player sprite sheet, and refresh supporting references/tests.

## Summary
- Authored `scripts/art/normalize_kira_evasion_pack.py` to extract, scale, and align the generated dash/slide frames; produced `image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack-normalized.png` plus a manifest.
- Merged the normalized frames into `image-ar-003-kira-core-pack-normalized.png`, updated `PlayerEntity` animations (dash=6 frames, slide=10), and refreshed Jest coverage to reflect the new frame counts.
- Regenerated locomotion reference captures via `scripts/art/capturePlayerLocomotionFrames.js`, updating `reports/art/player-locomotion-reference/manifest.json` so autosave overlays and QA packets reflect the normalized sheet.
- Synchronized asset manifests (`assets/images/requests.json`), backlog documentation, and MCP item M3-016 to record the completed normalization work and new next steps.

## Deliverables
- Normalization script + outputs: `scripts/art/normalize_kira_evasion_pack.py`, `assets/generated/images/ar-003/image-ar-003-kira-evasion-pack-normalized.png`, and `...-normalized.json`.
- Updated player atlas: `assets/generated/images/ar-003/image-ar-003-kira-core-pack-normalized.png` consumed by `src/game/entities/PlayerEntity.js`.
- Documentation & manifest refresh: `docs/assets/visual-asset-inventory.md`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, and `reports/art/player-locomotion-reference/manifest.json`.
- Quest reward test hardened to assert reputation deltas against current baselines (`tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js`).

## Verification
```bash
npm test
```

## Outstanding Work & Follow-ups
1. Swap in the bespoke idle/walk/run sprite sheet once delivered, then rerun traversal QA to ensure dash/slide transitions remain aligned (`M3-016` next step).
2. Repackage Save/Load autosave assets after the bespoke swap so validator baselines reflect the final art.
3. Continue monitoring faction reputation cascades during narrative playtests to validate the new baseline behaviour (session 178 follow-up).
