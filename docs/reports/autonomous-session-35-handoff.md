# Autonomous Development Session #35 – Engine Frame Hooks

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~0.4 hours (2025-10-28T14:55:00-07:00 – 2025-10-28T15:27:17-07:00)  
**Status**: Engine frame hooks in place; overlays rendered via main loop ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Added a first-class `Engine.setFrameHooks` API so external coordinators can participate in the core frame loop without duplicating `requestAnimationFrame` logic.
- Updated `Game.init()`/`cleanup()` to register and tear down per-frame update and overlay rendering hooks, ensuring `renderOverlays()` executes during runtime builds.
- Authored regression tests covering both the engine hook contract and the Game integration lifecycle.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Engine Frame Hooks**: `Engine._onFrame` now executes optional update and overlay callbacks before/after compositing, with defensive error logging (`src/engine/Engine.js`).
- **Game Hook Integration**: Game registers its update/overlay handlers through the new API and detaches them on cleanup, so HUD layers render consistently (`src/game/Game.js`).
- **Regression Coverage**: Added Jest suites validating engine hook invocation, Game registration, and cleanup behavior (`tests/engine/Engine.frameHooks.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.frameHooks.test.js`).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/engine/Engine.frameHooks.test.js tests/game/Game.frameHooks.test.js tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Manual UI Sweep – CORE-302**: Palette/layout review still pending once overlays stabilize visually.
2. **Debug HUD Playwright Coverage**: Need browser-level assertions for overlay listings now that runtime rendering is fixed.
3. **Inventory Edge Adoption**: Inventory UI remains placeholder; ensure future implementation hooks into `input:inventory:pressed` and the frame hooks.
4. **Runtime QA**: Run a browser build to confirm overlays render correctly with real canvas contexts (post-hook smoke still outstanding).

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Execute manual overlay polish checklist (CORE-302) leveraging functioning runtime overlays.
2. Implement Playwright smoke that verifies debug overlay listings during dialogue/tutorial flows.
3. Integrate upcoming Inventory UI with edge-triggered input and frame hooks.

---

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 5 (`src/engine/Engine.js`, `src/game/Game.js`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `tests/engine/Engine.frameHooks.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.frameHooks.test.js`)
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 2 new Jest suites
- **Automated Tests Run**: Targeted Jest command (see Verification)
- **Manual QA**: Not run (engine integration focus)

---

## Notes
- Architecture decision recorded: *Introduce Engine frame hooks for game-level update and overlay rendering* (ID: b25f2279-330c-4aa3-8e97-6d360ed82141).
- Session duration falls under the 4-hour guideline; continuing work was paused after delivering high-priority frame integration—resume with backlog items above next cycle.
