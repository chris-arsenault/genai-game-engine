# Autonomous Development Session #78 – Gameplay Adaptive Audio Planning
**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~1h20m  
**Status**: Authored implementation plans for adaptive audio emitters, quest trigger migration, and tilemap rotation fidelity; synchronized backlog and architecture decisions for the upcoming integration work.

---

## Highlights
- Captured gameplay-driven adaptive music architecture, introducing SuspicionMoodMapper, AdaptiveMoodEmitter, and a gameplay bridge to channel disguise/combat events into the shared AdaptiveMusic orchestrator.
- Defined Act 1 trigger migration utilities (Toolkit + Registry) to retire legacy InteractionZone flows while keeping quest metadata centralized for designers.
- Established tilemap rotation fidelity approach with rotation matrices, template variant resolver, and corridor seam painter to align rotated procedural rooms visually.

---

## Deliverables
- `docs/plans/adaptive-audio-emitter-plan.md` – Implementation plan for gameplay adaptive mood emitters and supporting utilities.
- `docs/plans/quest-trigger-migration-plan.md` – Migration plan covering Act 1 trigger conversions, toolkit scaffolding, and regression coverage.
- `docs/plans/tilemap-rotation-fidelity-plan.md` – Strategy for rotating tilemaps or selecting variants plus corridor seam painting.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Added Session #78 backlog updates mirroring new MCP items.

---

## Verification
- _No automated tests executed (documentation/architecture planning only)._

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Implement adaptive mood emitters (AUDIO-613)** – Build mapper/emitter utilities, integrate with Disguise and Firewall Scrambler systems, and add gameplay-driven audio tests.
2. **Migrate Act 1 triggers (QUEST-442)** – Deliver TriggerMigrationToolkit, QuestTriggerRegistry, and migrate crime scene + vendor triggers with regression coverage.
3. **Improve tilemap rotation fidelity (PROC-221)** – Implement rotation matrix utilities, variant resolver, and corridor seam painter; profile generator performance.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Begin Phase 1-2 work for adaptive mood emitters, prioritizing unit-tested mapper/emitter utilities before wiring gameplay bridges.
- Stand up QuestTriggerRegistry/toolkit and migrate a pilot trigger (crime scene) to validate schema alignment.
- Implement TileRotationMatrix prototype and benchmark generator impact while drafting seam painter API.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Created MCP backlog items: `AUDIO-613: Gameplay Adaptive Mood Emitters`, `QUEST-442: Act 1 Trigger Schema Migration`, and `PROC-221: Tilemap Rotation Fidelity`; mirrored under **Session #78 Backlog Updates** in `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- Stored architecture decisions: `Gameplay-driven adaptive mood emitter architecture`, `Standardize Act 1 quest triggers on Trigger component schema`, `Tilemap rotation fidelity strategy for procedural rooms`.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Planning session delivered three new implementation plans satisfying the “three development tasks” guardrail for this autonomous run.
- Consistency check confirms gameplay adaptive audio plan aligns with stored architecture decisions.
- No asset sourcing actions required; note future need for rotated tile variants if art coverage proves insufficient.
