# Autonomous Development Session #100 - Crossroads QA Automation & Schema Parity
**Date**: November 8, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h00m  
**Status**: Automated guardrails now cover Crossroads art ingest, narrative review packets ship with line anchors, and telemetry datasets can be checked against analytics schema before warehouse ingestion.

---

## Highlights
- Added an Act 2 Crossroads art validator and CLI so designers can confirm manifest/config coverage (asset IDs, metadata, alpha bounds) before in-engine sweeps.
- Extended the branch dialogue exporter with per-line anchors and choice labels, upgrading the Markdown packet for precise reviewer feedback.
- Introduced a telemetry schema checker + CLI to compare exported quest datasets against the canonical analytics schema ahead of production parity tests.

---

## Deliverables
- Art QA tooling: `src/game/tools/Act2CrossroadsArtValidator.js`, `tests/game/tools/Act2CrossroadsArtValidator.test.js`, `scripts/art/validateAct2CrossroadsArt.js`
- Narrative tooling: `src/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.js`, `tests/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.test.js`
- Telemetry parity: `src/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetrySchema.js`, `src/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetrySchemaChecker.js`, `tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetrySchemaChecker.test.js`, `scripts/telemetry/checkQuestTelemetryParity.js`
- Docs: `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/reports/autonomous-session-100-handoff.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/tools/Act2CrossroadsArtValidator.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/tools/Act2BranchDialogueExporter.test.js`
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/telemetry/QuestTelemetrySchemaChecker.test.js`

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Crossroads art QA sweep** – Run the validator against the bespoke bundle and follow with an in-engine lighting/collision walk to capture designer adjustments.
2. **Narrative copy review** – Circulate the anchor-enabled Markdown packet, collect edits from narrative/VO, and schedule exporter reruns for approved copy.
3. **Telemetry parity check** – Once the warehouse refresh drops new logs, use the schema checker alongside `npm run telemetry:dashboard` to confirm analytics expectations.

---

## Next Session Starting Points
- Execute the validator + in-engine sweep to finalise Crossroads art lighting, collision, and navigation notes.
- Gather targeted feedback on the anchored Markdown packet; fold confirmed copy tweaks back into dialogue assets and regenerate exports.
- Feed fresh quest telemetry through `scripts/telemetry/checkQuestTelemetryParity.js` prior to analytics sign-off.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- `QUEST-610` updated with Session 100 automation deliverables, refreshed next steps pointing to the new validator, Markdown anchors, and telemetry parity checker.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` mirrors the revised next-session focus highlighting the new QA tooling.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- Art validator covers 16 required segments, flags missing asset IDs/metadata, and reports parity stats for bespoke manifests.
- Dialogue exporter now emits padded line numbers and anchor IDs (`dialogue_* - LXX`), making reviewer comments traceable to source nodes.
- Telemetry schema checker enforces dataset, event, and payload field presence/type, surfacing unexpected fields as warnings before analytics ingestion.
