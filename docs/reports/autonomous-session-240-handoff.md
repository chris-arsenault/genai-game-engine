# Autonomous Development Session #240 – NPC Memory Persistence
**Date**: 2025-11-25  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~65m  
**Focus**: Close out M3-005 by wiring faction intel sharing, persistence, and automated coverage for the NPC memory system.

## Summary
- Extended `NPCMemorySystem` so faction allies automatically share recognition and crime intel, marking the player as known and recording shared history without manual triggers.
- Persisted NPC memory (recognition state, witnessed crimes, pending reports) and the player’s `knownBy` roster through `SaveManager`, ensuring save/load parity for investigative beats.
- Authored targeted Jest coverage to validate recognition sharing, crime intel propagation, and full serialize/deserialize round-trips; verified across the full Jest suite.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/systems/NPCMemorySystem.js` — Faction intel sharing for recognition/crime events plus serialize/deserialize support and helper utilities.
- `src/engine/SaveManager.js` — Save/load integration for NPC memory snapshots and player `FactionMember.knownBy` data with player query fallbacks.
- `src/game/components/FactionMember.js` — Normalized `knownBy` handling with `Set` guards and a setter for persistence restoration.
- `tests/game/systems/NPCMemorySystem.test.js` — New Jest suite covering recognition sharing, crime intel propagation, and persistence restoration.

## Verification
- `npm test`

## Backlog Updates
- `M3-005: NPC Component and Memory System` → `done` (faction intel sharing shipped with persistence + tests; documentation/backlog mirrored).

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Spin up `M3-006: NPCFactory` once faction/NPC intel foundations settle to streamline population work.
- Keep `M3-003: FactionSystem (ECS Integration)` on deck to capitalize on the new persistence hooks when broader faction behaviours come online.
