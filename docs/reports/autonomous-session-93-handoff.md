# Autonomous Development Session #93 - Resistance Hideout Bring-Up  
**Date**: November 8, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 - Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~3h15m  
**Status**: Resistance branch interior is now fully authored with quest scaffolding and loader coverage; personal investigation interior and production art/nav integration remain outstanding.

---

## Highlights
- Authored `loadAct2ResistanceHideoutScene` with resistance contact geometry, registry-driven triggers, navigation mesh metadata, and spawn handling that mirrors the corporate branch structure.
- Introduced `act2ResistanceQuest` scaffolding (`main-act2-archivist-alliance`) and re-ordered quest registration so Crossroads branches resolve thread quests before wiring narrative branches.
- Expanded the Act 2 thread loader/config to include the resistance branch, ensuring `Game.loadAct2ThreadScene` emits full metadata for both implemented interiors.
- Updated designer documentation (`docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`) and backlog progress notes to reflect the new branch coverage and remaining work.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/scenes/Act2ResistanceHideoutScene.js`
- `src/game/data/quests/act2ResistanceQuest.js`
- `src/game/Game.js`
- `src/game/config/GameConfig.js`
- `tests/game/scenes/Act2ResistanceHideoutScene.test.js`
- `tests/game/Game.act2ThreadScene.test.js`
- `docs/guides/act2-trigger-authoring.md`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/scenes/Act2ResistanceHideoutScene.test.js tests/game/Game.act2ThreadScene.test.js`
- `npm test` *(full suite surfaced the known `BSPGenerator` <10 ms perf assertion; reran `tests/game/procedural/BSPGenerator.test.js` in isolation and it passed within threshold.)*

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Personal investigation thread interior** — Scene, loader entry, quest scaffolding, and coverage are still absent; this blocks full branch parity.
2. **Crossroads art/navigation final drop** — Awaiting production mesh package; once delivered we must validate both interiors plus the hub against updated assets to ensure nav fidelity.
3. **Act 2 quest progression depth** — NeuroSync and Archivist threads need dialogue/objective expansion so interiors progress beyond entry scaffolding; analytics hooks should be audited after the additions.
4. **BSP performance flake** — Procedural generator perf test occasionally exceeds the 10 ms guard; monitor and consider widening threshold or profiling seed variance if the instability persists.

## Next Session Starting Points
- Build the personal investigation interior (geometry, triggers, nav mesh) and wire it into the loader/config registry with matching tests and documentation updates.
- Integrate the forthcoming Crossroads art/navigation bundle, re-running navigation and loader suites across all Act 2 scenes to confirm mesh fidelity.
- Expand Act 2 thread quests/dialogue so both NeuroSync and Archivist branches progress through multiple beats and unlock their systemic hooks.

---

## Backlog & MCP Sync
- Updated MCP backlog item `QUEST-610` with Session 93 progress, refreshed next steps, and linked the new regression coverage commands.
- Synced `docs/plans/backlog.md` to reflect the resistance interior milestone and remaining personal branch work.

---

## Metrics & Notes
- The resistance hideout navigation mesh ships nodes `hideout_entry`, `strategy_table`, and `escape_tunnel` for reuse by `NavigationMeshService`; trigger metadata exposes faction-alignment unlock hooks for analytics/UI systems.
- `QuestTriggerRegistry` now marks the resistance trigger trio as migrated, keeping outstanding migration reports focused on the remaining personal branch work.
