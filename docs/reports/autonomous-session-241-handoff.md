# Autonomous Development Session #241 – Game Loop Fixed Timestep
**Date**: 2025-11-26  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~70m  
**Focus**: Close backlog item M1-023 by delivering a fixed-timestep game loop with automation coverage.

## Summary
- Refined `GameLoop` with a fixed-timestep accumulator, capped catch-up steps, and pause/resume accumulator resets to prevent spiral-of-death scenarios.
- Exposed richer frame metrics (`stepCount`, `lag`) to support profiling overlays and external hooks consuming loop telemetry.
- Updated `GameLoop` unit suite to validate fixed-step behaviour, frame metric payloads, and guardrails on excessive catch-up iterations.
- Mirrored backlog state in `docs/plans/backlog.md`, marking M1-023 complete with recorded verification.

## Deliverables
- `src/engine/GameLoop.js`
- `tests/engine/GameLoop.test.js`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` (status sync)

## Verification
- `npm test`

## Backlog Updates
- `M1-023: Game Loop Implementation` → `done` (fixed timestep, paused-state handling, metrics surfaced, Jest coverage refreshed).

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Keep `CORE-303: Investigative Loop Skeleton` moving once quest plumbing hooks land; extend Playwright coverage to include deduction board beats.
- Maintain weekly automation sweeps for `AR-050: Visual Asset Sourcing Pipeline` until RenderOps acknowledgements arrive.
- Stage faction ECS work (`M3-003`) and deduction board UI foundation (`M2-005`) so they spin up immediately after dependencies unblock; ensure automated validation plans remain ready.
