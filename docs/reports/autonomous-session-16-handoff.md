# Autonomous Development Session #16 - Game State Observability Research

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~2.0 hours focused research & documentation  
**Status**: Centralized state management strategy defined ✅

---

## Executive Summary
- Delivered comparative analysis of centralized game state options, benchmarking Redux-style immutable stores against ECS-integrated world state.
- Recommended a hybrid **Event-Sourced WorldStateStore** that layers deterministic reducers on top of existing ECS mutations to provide observability, save/load parity, and tooling hooks without sacrificing performance.
- Captured findings in a new research dossier, recorded an architecture decision, and seeded backlog tasks PO-002 and PO-003 for the implementation phases.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Research Doc**: `docs/research/engine/game-state-management-comparison.md` (context, evaluation matrix, architecture diagram, migration plan, risks).
- **Prototype Benchmarks**: `benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js` with actionable performance baselines (dispatch mean 0.0036 ms vs component mutation 0.0011 ms; snapshot <0.1 ms).
- **Architecture Decision**: Stored ADR selecting the hybrid event-sourced approach (MCP ID `9896f0eb-a055-436a-b429-84bf76905ae3`).
- **Backlog Updates**: Added PO-002 (WorldStateStore foundation) and PO-003 (Quest/Tutorial/Dialogue migration) to `docs/plans/backlog.md`.
- **Research Cache**: Persisted findings under MCP topic `centralized-game-state-management`.

---

## Verification & Benchmarks
- `node benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js`
  - Redux-style immutable store: dispatch mean 0.0036 ms; selector mean 0.0231 ms; snapshot mean 0.0968 ms; 48.8 KB serialized.
  - ECS-integrated world state: mutation mean 0.0011 ms; facade query mean 0.0244 ms; snapshot mean 0.0997 ms; 52.2 KB serialized.
- No Jest/Playwright suites executed this session (pure research + planning). Recommend rerunning core tests once WorldStateStore implementation begins.

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **PO-002** – Implement WorldStateStore foundation (scaffold store, selectors, SaveManager integration, debug hooks).  
2. **PO-003** – Migrate Quest/Tutorial/Dialogue systems & UI to consume WorldStateStore selectors; add invariant and Playwright coverage.  
3. **Quest Log UI Rendering** – Remains unresolved from Session #14; should be validated once store-backed overlays land.  
4. **SaveManager LocalStorage Tests** – Still failing (see Session #15); plan to re-run after store integration to ensure parity.  
5. **Quest 001 End-to-End Playtest** – Pending; schedule once store groundwork is complete to validate narrative flow with new observability.

No new external blockers encountered. MCP services fully operational.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Approve ADR & finalize implementation plan for PO-002 (Store foundation).  
2. Begin coding WorldStateStore scaffolding + reducers with Jest coverage.  
3. Validate SaveManager parity using new selectors before switching live code paths.  
4. Prepare quest debug HUD concept in parallel with store to accelerate tooling adoption.

## Metrics
- **Files Added**: 2  
- **Files Modified**: 1  
- **Benchmarks Run**: 1 (`benchmarks/state-store-prototype.js`)  
- **Tests Pending**: Full Jest + Playwright suites (to execute alongside PO-002 implementation).  
- **Narrative Impact**: Enables deterministic tracking of branching quests and dialogue for upcoming playtest.
