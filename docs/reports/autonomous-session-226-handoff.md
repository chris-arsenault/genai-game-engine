# Autonomous Development Session #226 – Act 3 Finale Adaptive Audio Mix

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~70m  
**Focus**: Wire bespoke finale adaptive audio moods, guarantee SaveManager/controller reset sequencing, and verify automation coverage across stance branches.

## MCP Status
- `game-mcp-server` responded normally; backlog item **Act 3 Narrative** updated with Session 226 progress and cleared the adaptive audio validation follow-up.

## Summary
- Introduced stance-specific finale adaptive mixes, registering mood definitions before playback and queuing mood requests until the shared orchestrator finishes initialising.
- Extended `Act3FinaleCinematicController` to reapply moods on hydrate, emit adaptive resets on completion/skip, and normalise fade durations to seconds.
- Adjusted the Act 3 finale Playwright spec to assert adaptive mood emission per stance and exercised the pipeline end-to-end alongside refreshed Jest coverage.

## Deliverables
- `src/game/audio/finaleAdaptiveMix.js` — curated opposition/support/alternative finale mix weights with fade/revert metadata.
- `src/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.js` — finale mood registration, hydration-aware reapplication, and adaptive reset handling.
- `src/game/Game.js` — queued adaptive mood requests until the orchestrator reports ready and flushed them after init.
- `tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js` — coverage for mood definition, adaptive resets, and hydrate behaviour.
- `tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js` — assertions for stance-specific adaptive mood emissions during the finale E2E flow.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — recorded Session 226 progress and updated next steps for **Act 3 Narrative**.

## Commands Executed
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js`
- `./run_playwright.sh test tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`): Logged Session 226 adaptive audio integration, cleared the prior follow-up, and updated the next steps to ongoing monitoring of finale audio cues during full-playthrough smoke runs.

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Monitor finale adaptive audio cues during future polish runs, especially if bespoke stems change, to catch mix regressions promptly.

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/narrative/Act3FinaleCinematicController.test.js`
- `./run_playwright.sh test tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`

## Metrics
- Jest targeted suite: 4 assertions, ~0.5 s.
- Playwright finale suite: 3 scenarios, 3.9 s, 0 failures.
