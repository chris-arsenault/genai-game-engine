# Autonomous Development Session #39 ‚Äì Black Market Vendor & Inventory Telemetry

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 ‚Äì Final Polish & Production  
**Session Duration**: ~4.5 hours (2025-10-30T09:05:00-07:00 ‚Äì 2025-10-30T13:35:00-07:00)  
**Status**: Black market vendor branch shipped; profiling harness pending üöß

---

## Executive Summary
- Introduced the Black Market Broker optional vendor in Act 1 with purchase and leverage-based trade paths that emit knowledge events and full economy metadata.
- Enhanced InventoryOverlay to surface vendor acquisition context (cost, timestamp, vendor markers) and expanded DialogueSystem with currency-aware conditions plus declarative consequence events.
- Added targeted Jest coverage for the new vendor content/UI telemetry and logged a backlog item to restore the broken `npm run profile` harness.

---

## Key Outcomes
- **Black Market Broker**: Authored `DIALOGUE_BLACK_MARKET_VENDOR`, spawned the NPC in `Act1Scene`, and wired an optional quest objective rewarding `black_market_transit_routes` intel (`src/game/data/dialogues/Act1Dialogues.js`, `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`, `src/game/data/quests/act1Quests.js`).
- **Vendor Metadata Pipeline**: Augmented the Game vendor bridge to stamp transaction cost/context/timestamps into inventory metadata and highlight vendor tags (`src/game/Game.js`).
- **Inventory Overlay Telemetry**: Rendered vendor summaries (vendor/faction, cost, acquisition method, timestamp) and list markers for vendor loot (`src/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.js`).
- **Dialogue Enhancements**: Added `hasCurrency`/`notHasCurrency` condition support, merged story flags from WorldStateStore, and implemented consequence `events` emission for knowledge updates (`src/game/data/DialogueTree.js`, `src/game/systems/DialogueSystem.js`).
- **Tests & Documentation**: Added Jest suites for black market dialogue data and vendor UI summaries, refreshed backlog/changelog, and documented the Broker in narrative character notes (`tests/game/data/Act1Dialogues.blackMarketVendor.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.vendorSummary.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/narrative/characters/black-market-broker.md`).

---

## Verification
- `npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/game/data/Act1Dialogues.blackMarketVendor.test.js tests/game/Game.vendorPurchases.test.js tests/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.vendorSummary.test.js tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js`
  - ‚úÖ Pass ‚Äì validates vendor dialogue data, inventory UI metadata rendering, and currency-aware dialogue conditions.
- `npm run profile`
  - ‚ùå Fails with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND: src/benchmark.js` ‚Äî profiling harness missing; logged backlog item PERF-214.

---

## Outstanding Work & Risks
1. **Profiling Harness Missing**: `npm run profile` cannot execute; without profiling we cannot measure vendor autosave cost (tracked as PERF-214).
2. **Runtime QA Sweep**: Still need `vite preview` smoke with black market vendor present to ensure overlays behave during manual play.
3. **Economy UI Expansion**: Broker currently exposes a single intel item; future vendors and UI flows must ingest the new metadata pattern.

---

## Suggested Next Session Priorities
1. Restore the profiling entry point and capture a baseline run including vendor purchases.
2. Execute runtime/manual smoke (vite preview + Playwright) with the broker dialogue to validate overlays and optional objective wiring.
3. Extend vendor roster (additional smugglers/faction shops) leveraging the new metadata pipeline and dialogue condition hooks.

## Metrics
- **Files Touched**: 14  
  `src/game/data/dialogues/Act1Dialogues.js`, `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`, `src/game/data/quests/act1Quests.js`, `src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.js`, `src/game/systems/DialogueSystem.js`, `src/game/data/DialogueTree.js`, `tests/game/Game.vendorPurchases.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/data/Act1Dialogues.blackMarketVendor.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.vendorSummary.test.js`, `docs/plans/backlog.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/narrative/characters/black-market-broker.md`
- **Tests Added/Updated**: 4 Jest suites (black market dialogue, vendor UI telemetry, DialogueSystem currency/events, Game vendor pipeline)
- **Automated Tests Run**: Targeted Jest command above
- **Manual QA**: Not run (pending profiling harness & preview smoke)

---

## Notes
- Backlog updated: INV-304 recorded as completed; new PERF-214 backlog item captures profiling harness restoration.
- Narrative docs now include character sheet for the Black Market Broker to align with optional quest integration.
- Canvas profiling attempt created no actionable data; remove v8 isolate logs after harness fix to avoid repo noise.
