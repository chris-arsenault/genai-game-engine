# Autonomous Development Session #213 – Act 3 Finale E2E Validation

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Sprint**: Sprint 8 – Final Polish & Production  
**Duration**: ~70m  
**Focus**: Harden finale readiness by exercising the Act 3 Zenith infiltration pipeline end-to-end through Playwright automation.

## Summary
- Authored a dedicated Playwright scenario that simulates shared plus stance-specific Zenith infiltration stages, ensuring quest completion emits `narrative:finale_cinematic_ready` and drives the finale controller/overlay state.
- Stabilised test harness branch chaining by registering a stub Archive Heart quest so QuestManager branch evaluation stays silent during automated finale runs.
- Mirrored backlog adjustments to reflect the new coverage and remove the Playwright scheduling action from outstanding work.

## Deliverables
- `tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`: End-to-end coverage validating Act 3 finale readiness dispatch, overlay beat advancement, and adaptive controller state after sequential shared/opposition/support/alternative stage emissions.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`: Logged Session 213 backlog notes and trimmed obsolete Playwright TODOs from earlier sessions so documentation mirrors MCP state.

## Backlog Updates
- **Act 3 Narrative** (`415b4bd3-2053-400e-92a5-1f1fceccc632`) — Added Session 213 entry documenting the new Playwright suite, updated completed work, and removed the Playwright coverage action from next steps (remaining items: stance-specific dialogue beats, bespoke finale asset integration).

## Outstanding Work & Next Steps
- Author stance-specific Zenith infiltration dialogue beats and prompts once scene layouts settle.
- Hook bespoke finale cinematic assets into the controller/overlay pipeline once renders land, ensuring cinematic playback consumes the sequencer payload cleanly.

## Verification
- `./run_playwright.sh test tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`

## Metrics
- E2E Suites: +1 (`tests/e2e/act3-zenith-finale.spec.js`)
- Finale Lifecycle Events Exercised: `narrative:finale_cinematic_{ready,begin,beat_advanced}` confirmed via automation recorder.
