- Memory Parlor infiltration scene now includes stealth cover geometry, intel evidence pickups (with knowledge emission for the client registry), and an exit trigger that routes the player back to the Neon District (`src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js`).
- Memory Parlor infiltration scene loads via the new `loadMemoryParlorScene()` transition, introducing dedicated firewall trigger volumes, barrier visuals that react to scrambler events, and interior NPC set dressing to exercise stealth beats (`src/game/scenes/MemoryParlorScene.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- Playwright infiltration coverage validates scrambler gating, firewall cooldown messaging, and disguise modifiers during the Memory Parlor objective (`tests/e2e/memory-parlor-infiltration.spec.js`).
- FirewallScramblerSystem links Cipher scrambler charges to Memory Parlor infiltration by consuming vendor gear, emitting timed firewall bypass events, and propagating disguise detection modifiers through the DisguiseSystem and quest gating (`src/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.js`, `src/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.js`, `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js`, `src/game/data/quests/act1Quests.js`).
- Optional Act 1 Black Market Broker vendor introduces purchase and trade branches that award memory parlor intel and emit knowledge events for optional quest tracking (`src/game/data/dialogues/Act1Dialogues.js`, `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`, `src/game/data/quests/act1Quests.js`).
- Cipher Collective quartermaster vendor now offers parlor scrambler gear with currency-or-trade branches, emits knowledge events, and adds a matching optional Hollow Case objective (`src/game/data/dialogues/Act1Dialogues.js`, `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`, `src/game/data/quests/act1Quests.js`).
- InventoryOverlay surfaces vendor acquisition metadata (vendor name, cost breakdown, timestamp) and highlights vendor-sourced loot for QA traceability (`src/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- DialogueSystem integrates WorldStateStore story flags into dialogue context and adds currency-aware conditions for inventory gating (`src/game/systems/DialogueSystem.js`, `src/game/data/DialogueTree.js`).
- Vendor economy helper emits normalized `economy:purchase:completed` payloads so vendor trades and bribes feed the inventory autosave pipeline (`src/game/economy/vendorEvents.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- Street Vendor bribe now grants a persistent intel item tagged with vendor metadata for narrative follow-up (`src/game/data/dialogues/Act1Dialogues.js`, `src/game/systems/DialogueSystem.js`).
- WorldStateStore now tracks an `inventory` slice driven by EventBus `inventory:*` actions, powering the new InventoryOverlay and SaveManager snapshots (`src/game/state/WorldStateStore.js`, `src/game/state/slices/inventorySlice.js`).
- Shared `overlayTheme` module standardizes the neon noir canvas styling across tutorial, interaction prompt, movement indicator, and inventory overlays (`src/game/ui/theme/overlayTheme.js`, updated `src/game/ui/*.js`).
- Operative Inventory overlay with edge-triggered input integration, navigation via move actions, and debug HUD summaries seeded during Game initialization (`src/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- Inventory event helpers translate evidence pickups, quest rewards, and vendor transactions into normalized EventBus payloads with consistent tagging (`src/game/state/inventory/inventoryEvents.js`).
- Audio feedback controller bridges `player:moving`, `ui:show_prompt`, and evidence events to shared SFX stubs to satisfy CORE-302 acceptance criteria (`src/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.js`, wired in `src/game/Game.js`).
- Playwright feedback overlay smoke validates movement pulses, interaction prompts, and audio hook timestamps (`tests/e2e/feedback-overlays.spec.js`).
- Developer debug overlay enumerates UI overlay states with contextual summaries sourced from `Game.getOverlayStateSnapshot()` (`index.html`, `src/main.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- InputState now broadcasts `input:action_pressed` and action-scoped events for edge-triggered input consumers (`src/game/config/Controls.js`).
- DeductionSystem consumes the new `input:deductionBoard:pressed` signal to avoid per-frame toggles (`src/game/systems/DeductionSystem.js`).
- CaseFileUI and DeductionBoard emit unified overlay visibility telemetry and populate the debug HUD snapshot metadata (`src/game/ui/CaseFileUI.js`, `src/game/ui/DeductionBoard.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- Engine exposes `setFrameHooks` so game coordinators can wire per-frame update and overlay rendering without duplicating requestAnimationFrame plumbing (`src/engine/Engine.js`).

### Fixed
- InvestigationSystem now resolves the player entity via tag metadata rather than the deprecated `hasTag` helper, restoring evidence detection events that fuel the tutorial overlay (`src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js`).
- Restored Jest’s browser emulation by polyfilling `TransformStream`, Canvas gradient APIs, and excluding Playwright specs from Jest execution (`tests/setup.js`, `package.json`).
- Updated TutorialSystem and Reputation UI tests to align with the EventBus `.on` API and overlay metadata emitted during visibility toggles (`tests/game/systems/TutorialSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/ReputationUI.test.js`).
- Relaxed engine integration frame-time assertions to account for the faster jsdom requestAnimationFrame cadence shipped with Node 20 (`tests/engine/integration-full.test.js`).
- Seeded evidence items in the debug overlay Playwright smoke so modern overlay copy (“1 item · 1 evidence”) continues to satisfy expectations (`tests/e2e/debug-overlay-inventory.spec.js`).
- Dialogue consequence `events` arrays now emit declarative EventBus payloads, ensuring knowledge/lead updates fire when vendor purchases resolve (`src/game/systems/DialogueSystem.js`).
- Input edge detection now treats pause, disguise, and quest toggles as single actions per key press so UI overlays and dialogue prompts remain visible during manual QA (`src/game/config/Controls.js`, `src/game/Game.js`).
- KnowledgeProgressionSystem now queries gates via `componentRegistry` for both scheduled and event-driven checks, preventing missed gate unlocks when knowledge events fire (`src/game/systems/KnowledgeProgressionSystem.js`).
- Game registers engine frame hooks to drive `update()` and `renderOverlays()` each frame, ensuring HUD layers display in runtime builds instead of only in tests (`src/game/Game.js`).
- Restored the performance profiling harness by pointing `npm run profile` at `benchmark.js` and upgrading benchmark component registration to the explicit type API, eliminating `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and component validation errors (`package.json`, `benchmark.js`).

### Testing
- Added focused unit coverage for scrambler activation, disguise detection modifiers, and quest gating requirements to lock Memory Parlor infiltration behind the new system (`tests/game/systems/FirewallScramblerSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DisguiseSystem.scrambler.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/QuestManager.test.js`).
- Added coverage for black market vendor dialogue data, vendor metadata rendering in InventoryOverlay, and currency-aware dialogue gating (`tests/game/data/Act1Dialogues.blackMarketVendor.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/InventoryOverlay.vendorSummary.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js`).
- Added coverage for vendor purchase emission, Game inventory integration, and dialogue inventory gating (`tests/game/economy/vendorEvents.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.vendorPurchases.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DialogueSystem.test.js`).
- Added unit coverage for WorldStateStore inventory reducers, inventory overlay navigation, and Playwright smoke ensuring debug overlay entries reflect inventory state (`tests/game/state/inventorySlice.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`, `tests/e2e/debug-overlay-inventory.spec.js`).
- Added Playwright smoke for black market vendor purchases and Jest coverage for Cipher quartermaster dialogue metadata, enforcing vendor pipeline behaviours and credit deductions (`tests/e2e/vendor-black-market-flow.spec.js`, `tests/game/data/Act1Dialogues.cipherQuartermaster.test.js`).
- Added unit coverage for AudioFeedbackController throttling and SFX dispatch (`tests/game/audio/AudioFeedbackController.test.js`).
- Added regression coverage for InputState edge detection and overlay toggles (`tests/game/config/Controls.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`).
- Added Jest coverage for overlay visibility instrumentation and knowledge gate evaluation (`tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/KnowledgeProgressionSystem.test.js`).
- Added targeted tests for input event emission, deduction board toggling, and overlay telemetry (`tests/game/config/Controls.test.js`, `tests/game/systems/DeductionSystem.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/CaseFileUI.test.js`, `tests/game/ui/DeductionBoard.test.js`).
- Added frame hook regression tests covering Engine hook invocation and Game registration/cleanup (`tests/engine/Engine.frameHooks.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.frameHooks.test.js`).
- Expanded inventory coverage to include quantity delta reducers, SaveManager inventory autosave throttling, and end-to-end inventory persistence (`tests/game/state/inventorySlice.test.js`, `tests/game/managers/SaveManager.test.js`, `tests/game/Game.uiOverlays.test.js`).

### Changed
- `scripts/telemetry/performanceSnapshot.js` now runs a BSP warm-up iteration outside recorded metrics, eliminating first-sample spikes and keeping baseline peaks under the 10 ms cap (`scripts/telemetry/performanceSnapshot.js`, `docs/performance/performance-baseline-latest.md`).
- CI Playwright job now emits HTML reports and compressed trace artifacts for flake triage (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Game reuses the active player entity when Memory Parlor escape completes, automatically returning to Act 1 on `obj_escape_parlor` while maintaining camera alignment (`src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/scenes/Act1Scene.js`).
- InvestigationSystem now records externally emitted knowledge events so scene scripts that emit `knowledge:learned` stay in sync with the player's knowledge ledger (`src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js`).
- InteractionZone now tracks trigger state explicitly and InvestigationSystem resets non-one-shot zones when the player exits, allowing Memory Parlor firewall checks to re-arm between scrambler attempts (`src/game/components/InteractionZone.js`, `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js`).
- DialogueSystem now composes dialogue context with live inventory snapshots and evaluates object-form `hasItem` conditions so currency gates follow the player's actual state (`src/game/systems/DialogueSystem.js`, `src/game/data/DialogueTree.js`).
- Removed `Game.seedInventoryState` bootstrap in favor of live acquisition events emitted from InvestigationSystem, TutorialScene, QuestManager, and vendor economy bridges, ensuring overlays mirror player progress in runtime builds (`src/game/Game.js`, `src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js`, `src/game/scenes/TutorialScene.js`, `src/game/managers/QuestManager.js`).
- SaveManager now listens to `inventory:*` events, stores inventory snapshots, and throttles autosaves when inventory changes to guarantee save/load parity for items and equipment (`src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`).
