# Act 3 Dialogue — Final Deduction War Room

## Scene Overview
- **Quest Tie-In**: `main-act3-final-deduction`
- **Location**: Resistance HQ war room inside Nexus Station
- **Timeline**: Opening beats of Act 3 immediately after Kira survives the Act 2 confrontation.
- **Purpose**: Synthesize every clue, confront Dr. Morrow's intentions, and set up the three Act 3 resolution paths (Opposition, Support, Alternative).
- **Tone**: High-stakes investigative briefing with competing ethical priorities; simmering tension under disciplined urgency.

## Participants
- **Kira** — Player character, leading the briefing, juggling truth versus fallout.
- **Zara** — Resistance strategist, pragmatic, worries about civilian cost.
- **Soren** — Memory Syndicate ideologue, fiercely pro-transparency.
- **Dr. Mei Chen** — NeuroSync defector, carrying guilt and critical access codes.
- **Iris** — Archive intelligence ghost, provides data overlays and dry wit.
- **Optional Ally Slots** — Filled based on prior Act 2 recruiting (Captain Reese, Dmitri); used as non-blocking flavour lines.

## Branch Skeleton
1. **Shared Phase** — Kira convenes the war room, Iris projects the conspiracy timeline, everyone confronts Morrow's broadcast plan.
2. **Branch Declaration** — Player dialogue wheel grants three stances:
   - `Opposition` — Stop Morrow to protect the population (Ending A path).
   - `Support` — Assist Morrow and prepare for controlled chaos (Ending C path).
   - `Alternative` — Reveal the truth without mass trauma (Ending B path).
3. **Branch Fallout** — Each stance seeds the quest chain for `main-act3-gathering-support`.

## Dialogue Script

### Phase 1: Convene & Reveal (Shared)

**Kira**: "Everyone's here. Good. We only get one chance at this."  
**Iris**: "Uploading composite timeline. Please direct your outrage to the highlighted atrocities."  
*(Holographic timeline unfurls across the table.)*  
**Zara**: "Thirty years of corporate coverups... and he's been hoarding it like a warhead."  
**Dr. Chen** *(voice hushed)*: "Morrow should have shredded NeuroSync after the massacre. Instead he perfected it. I helped him. That blood is still on my schematics."  
**Soren**: "He preserved the evidence we needed. Without him, the truth dies in corporate vaults."  
**Kira**: "Focus. The anniversary broadcast goes live in forty-eight hours. Iris?"  
**Iris**: "Confirmed. Sixteen synchronized uplinks. If Morrow hijacks them, every neural implant in the city relives the massacre."  
**Zara**: "That's millions of minds overwhelmed at once. Panic. Riots. People die."  
**Soren**: "Or people finally understand what's been done to them. Justice at scale."  
**Dr. Chen**: "Justice without consent is still violence."  
**Kira**: "We decide tonight. How we act determines the ending this city gets."

*(Dialogue wheel opens with three options; player choice sets the next phase.)*

### Phase 2A: Opposition Branch — "We stop him."

**Kira** *(hard voice)*: "No one asked to relive the massacre. We stop Morrow before he detonates the city."  
**Zara** *(relieved exhale)*: "Then we need a path into the broadcast spine before he locks it."  
**Dr. Chen**: "I still have the failsafe credentials. They'll burn me the second I use them."  
**Kira**: "I'll be your shield. Iris, map the path."  
**Iris**: "Plotting infiltration vectors. Warning: success probability plummets without Soren's intel."  
**Soren** *(icy stare)*: "You're asking me to betray the only man still fighting for the truth."  
**Kira**: "I'm asking you to prevent another massacre. Help us expose the evidence without detonating minds."  
*(Persuasion check node triggers — locks or unlocks Soren's cooperation based on relationship.)*  
**If Soren Persuaded**:  
 **Soren** *(voice cracking)*: "Fine. I'll open the Archive's maintenance spine. But if you falter, I finish what he started."  
**Else**:  
 **Soren**: "No. I won't let fear win again. Do what you want; I won't be part of this." *(Soren flagged as hostile in later encounters.)*  
**Zara**: "We strike fast, before he reroutes the failsafes. Captain Reese still owes me; I'll see if the MCD can jam the outer perimeter."  
**Kira**: "Move. We stop the broadcast, then we reveal the truth on our terms."

**Branch Outcomes**:
- Unlock quest beats to secure Dr. Chen's backdoor codes and neutralize the broadcast array.
- Sets persuasion flag on Soren influencing Act 3 resistances encounters.

### Phase 2B: Support Branch — "We help him finish it."

**Kira** *(measured, resolute)*: "The truth burns, but lies rot the city from within. We help Morrow broadcast, and we pick up the pieces afterward."  
**Soren** *(heated grin)*: "At last. We end the silence."  
**Zara** *(shocked)*: "Kira, millions will relive the massacre. They won't walk away the same."  
**Kira**: "They shouldn't. We'll station trauma teams, control the flow, keep the city from tearing itself apart."  
**Dr. Chen**: "If we strengthen the signal, it becomes irreversible. No way to undo it once it starts."  
**Kira**: "Then we design safeguards. Iris, how do we amplify without frying implants?"  
**Iris**: "Spooling recommendations. You'll need three uplink boosters and a quantum sync key Morrow lacks. Acquisition probability: 42%."  
**Zara**: "I'll mobilize the resistance to protect civilians on the ground. If this implodes, their lives are on you."  
**Soren**: "I'll notify Morrow. He warned me you'd see sense."  
**Dr. Chen** *(voice breaking)*: "If we do this, I want guarantees—grief counselors, sedation protocols. I won't watch another generation shattered."  
**Kira**: "Done. Help me design them."  

**Branch Outcomes**:
- Initiates objectives to reinforce the broadcast infrastructure and stage post-broadcast relief networks.
- Locks in cooperative stance with Morrow; raises suspicion with law enforcement factions.

### Phase 2C: Alternative Branch — "We reveal the truth without the trauma."

**Kira** *(calm intensity)*: "There has to be another way. We expose everything without dumping agony into every mind."  
**Soren** *(scathing)*: "Soft compromises built this cage."  
**Kira**: "Maybe. But scorched earth justice collapses the city before we can rebuild it."  
**Zara**: "If you want a middle path, we need proof even the council can't bury."  
**Iris**: "Suggestion: compile a synchronized release—documents, testimony, sensory records—distributed through decentralized nodes."  
**Dr. Chen**: "I can extract NeuroSync's vault. With enough evidence, even the board can't deny it."  
**Kira**: "We form a coalition. Journalists, activists, anyone with reach. We flood the world with undeniable truth, staged to keep people grounded."  
**Soren** *(derisive laugh)*: "You think corporate media will air their own execution? You're dreaming."  
**Kira**: "Then help me build something they can't silence. Stand with me, or keep shouting from the shadows while nothing changes."  
*(Diplomacy challenge triggers; success keeps Soren aligned, failure drives him to sabotage later.)*  
**If Soren Convinced**:  
 **Soren** *(quiet)*: "You force my hand again, Kira. One last gamble. I'll connect you to the dissidents who still trust me."  
**Else**:  
 **Soren**: "No. Truth without shock is just another delay. Do this without me." *(Soren flagged as rogue asset; triggers opposition beats.)*  
**Zara**: "I'll draft the distribution matrix. We'll need encrypted mirrors across every district."  
**Dr. Chen**: "I'll testify. Full confession. NeuroSync can't bury me twice."  
**Kira**: "Then we start compiling. No more secrets. No more mass trauma. Just the truth, piece by piece."

**Branch Outcomes**:
- Opens coalition-building missions and evidence acquisition objectives.
- Sets Soren's alignment flag determining Act 3 sabotage or support events.

### Phase 3: Closing Beat (Shared Wrap-Up)

**Iris**: "Consensus recorded. Routing mission threads to your HUD. Please try not to die; I'm running out of sarcastic quips."  
**Zara**: "Whatever path we chose, we own it. Gear up."  
**Dr. Chen**: "I'll prep the lab. Every second we wait, Morrow tightens his grip."  
**Soren** *(branch-dependent tone)*:  
- *If allied*: "The Archive listens. Let's give it something worth remembering."  
- *If opposed*: "You're turning your back on revelation. Don't expect mercy when the truth hits."  
**Kira** *(inner monologue)*: "One city. One truth. And the cost we'll pay to reach it."  
*(Screen fades to mission briefing UI; Act 3 questlines update based on branch flags.)*

## Integration Notes
- Log branch decisions in the narrative state machine as `act3Stance = opposition|support|alternative`.
- Reuse persuasion gates from Act 2 relationship tracking (`sorenTrust`, `drChenGuilt`, `zaraConfidence`) to determine branch-specific ally outcomes.
- Tie new codex entries to the holographic timeline reveal for players who want deeper lore context.
- Use Iris' timeline projection as a diegetic recap for players who arrive at Act 3 after long breaks.
