#### Evidence Collected

- Encrypted data logs (extraction records, client identities)
- Curator's neural signature (key evidence, unique identifier)

     - Deeper forensic analysis available

3. **Recover critical evidence**
   - Regardless of timing, Kira finds:
     - Memory drive (intentionally left behind? Trap?)
     - Eraser equipment (proves corporate involvement)
     - NeuroSync server coordinates (verified, current)
   - If victim saved: Victim's terrified testimony (Erasers mentioned "The Curator")

4. **The memory drive revelation**
   - Kira plays the memory drive in safehouse
   - Auto-plays: Security footage from three years ago

- **She was investigating this before**: The case that destroyed her career is this case
- **Curator knows her**: This is personal, not coincidence
- **NeuroSync server is the Archive**: Where memories are stored

#### Choices and Consequences

- **How to handle the revelation?**
  - Tell Zara and Dmitri: Share burden, gain emotional support, but vulnerability
  - Keep secret: Maintain control, but isolate self, paranoia grows

- **What to do about the victim?** (if saved)
  - Protect them: Bring to safehouse, potential ally but danger to team
  - Send away: Give them money to leave city, safer but lose witness

#### Rewards

- **Memory Trace ability unlocked**: Kira can now follow neural residue trails (metroidvania ability)
- Forged Mid-City credentials (acquired from Zara)
- Act 1 completion XP and skill point
- Case board major update: Conspiracy web visualized

#### Narrative Beats
