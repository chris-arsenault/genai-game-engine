## Major Choice: The Memory Gamble

### M2.7: Restoration or Perseverance

**Quest ID**: `main-act2-memory-choice`
**Location**: Archive access point OR resistance backup location
**Prerequisites**: Complete M2.6
**Estimated Duration**: 30-45 minutes

#### Setup

Kira knows her memories are in The Archive, separated from others
Two options presented:
1. **Restore memories**: Access Archive, download her extracted consciousness
2. **Stay fragmented**: Continue with current self, piece truth together through investigation

#### Restore Memories Path

**Objectives**:
1. Infiltrate Archive with Soren's help
2. Access her memory files (special protocol)
3. Download and integrate extracted memories
4. Cutscene: Experience her past

**Consequences**:
- **Narrative**: Gain complete understanding of past relationship with Morrow
- **Mechanical**: Deduction puzzles become easier (hints provided)
- **Character**: Kira traumatized by restored memories, dialogue changes
- **Gameplay**: Debuff to combat/stealth (distracted, psychologically wounded)

**Rewards**:
- Full knowledge of past
- Special dialogue options in Act 3
- Easier investigation puzzles

#### Stay Fragmented Path

**Objectives**:
1. Resist temptation to restore
2. Commit to discovering truth organically
3. Trust current self over past self

**Consequences**:
- **Narrative**: Kira maintains agency, defines herself by present choices
- **Mechanical**: Deduction puzzles remain challenging
- **Character**: Kira maintains emotional stability, stronger in combat
- **Gameplay**: No debuffs, but harder final investigation

**Rewards**:
- Emotional strength
- No mechanical debuffs
- Character growth through adversity

#### Player Choice

- Present both options clearly
- No "correct" choiceâ€”different experiences
- Choice affects Act 3 dialogue and approach to Morrow
- Both paths lead to same ending options

## Act 2 Ending

### Closing Scene

**Location**: Resistance headquarters, Nexus Station

Kira recovers from Archive escape, surrounded by allies:
- Zara: "Well, that was terrifying."
- Soren: "Now we know where he is. We can stop him."
- Dr. Chen (if allied): "Or help him. The evidence he's gathered could change everything."

Kira visits Dmitri in care facility:

Kira receives encrypted message from Morrow:
*"You wanted to forget. I let you. Now you remember. What will you choose this time?
The city's 50th anniversary approaches. The Archive will open.
You have three options: Stop me. Help me. Or find what neither of us couldâ€”a better way.
I'll be waiting at the Archive's heart.
Finish what we started, Detective."*
