# Act 1 Playtest Gaps Analysis - Research Report

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Session:** Sprint 7-8 Transition (Session 12)
**Researcher:** research-gameplay agent
**Focus:** Identify untested systems, critical gaps, and polish opportunities for Act 1

---

## Executive Summary

Act 1 is architecturally sound (95% ready per Session 11 playtest) with one critical bug fixed (dialogue registration). However, **significant playtest gaps remain** that could hide showstopper bugs or UX friction points. This report identifies 8 untested/undertested areas that MUST be validated before declaring Act 1 "production ready."

**Key Finding:** Only **1 playtest session exists** (code review-based), with **zero live manual playthroughs** and **zero E2E automated tests**. Testing coverage is strong at the unit level (67 test files, 99.9% pass rate) but integration and player experience validation is absent.

---

## 1. Review of Existing Playtest Data

### MCP Playtest Database Summary
- **Total Feedback Entries:** 1
- **Severity Breakdown:** 1 critical (now fixed)
- **Focus Areas:** Quest system, dialogue system, integration, UI wiring
- **Build:** cc9f4ec (session-11 branch)

### Session 11 Playtest Report Analysis
**Source:** `/docs/playtesting/playtest-2025-10-27-act1-validation.md`

**Strengths Identified:**
- Quest architecture clean (Manager→System→UI separation)
- All 5 quests properly structured
- Dialogue trees show excellent writing with meaningful branching
- UI components properly wired to event bus
- 99.9% test pass rate (1,740/1,744 tests)

**Critical Bug (FIXED):**
- Dialogue registration method mismatch (`registerDialogue()` vs `registerDialogueTree()`)
- Status: Fixed in session-11/session-12

**Remaining Concerns from Report:**
1. Quest branch condition syntax unclear (`obj_optional_informant: true`)
2. Count-based objective triggers not integration-tested
3. **NO UI component tests** for QuestLogUI, QuestTrackerHUD, QuestNotification
4. Missing auto-start visual feedback
5. Ability unlock timing unclear (detective vision vs memory trace)
6. No error handling for missing dialogues
7. Quest positioning uses magic numbers

---

## 2. Untested Systems and Features

### 2.1 ❌ CRITICAL: Save/Load System (NOT TESTED)

**Evidence:**
- SaveManager implemented (`src/game/managers/SaveManager.js`)
- **NO test file found** for SaveManager
- Autosave triggers on quest completion, area entry, case completion
- Multiple save slots supported

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **No validation that save/load preserves quest state**
   - What happens if player saves mid-quest with 2/9 objectives complete?
   - Are objective counters preserved? (evidence:collected count:3)
   - Are quest branches preserved after reload?

2. **No validation of dialogue state persistence**
   - Are completed dialogue trees tracked?
   - Can players re-trigger dialogues after reload?

3. **No validation of story flag restoration**
   - Do story flags (`case_001_solved`, etc.) survive save/load?
   - Are faction reputation changes preserved?

4. **No testing of autosave timing**
   - Does autosave interrupt gameplay?
   - Performance impact during autosave?

**Player Impact:** HIGH - Players expect saves to work. Broken saves = lost progress = abandoned game.

**Testing Priority:** CRITICAL - Must test before vertical slice release.

---

### 2.2 ❌ CRITICAL: Quest Branch Logic (NOT INTEGRATION TESTED)

**Evidence:**
- Quest 002 has branching logic based on optional objective
- QuestManager has branch evaluation logic
- **NO integration test** validates branch conditions work end-to-end

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Optional objective branch condition syntax unclear:**
   ```javascript
   // Quest 002 branch
   condition: {
     storyFlags: ['case_002_solved'],
     obj_optional_informant: true  // ⚠️ Non-standard syntax
   }
   ```
   - Does QuestManager support `obj_optional_informant` syntax?
   - Is this checking objective completion or a story flag?

2. **No test validates branch path switching:**
   - Case 002 → Case 003 (if optional objective completed)
   - Case 002 → Case 004 (if optional objective skipped) → Case 003
   - Do both paths properly unlock Case 005?

3. **No test validates branch prerequisite checking:**
   - What if player somehow triggers both branches?
   - What if neither branch condition is met?

**Player Impact:** HIGH - Broken branching = blocked progression or duplicate quests.

**Testing Priority:** CRITICAL - Must test branching before Sprint 8 completion.

---

### 2.3 ❌ HIGH: Count-Based Objective Triggers (NOT INTEGRATION TESTED)

**Evidence:**
- Multiple quests use count-based triggers:
  - Quest 001, obj 3: `evidence:collected count:3`
  - Quest 001, obj 6: `evidence:collected count:5`
  - Quest 004, obj 3: `npc:interviewed count:3`
- QuestManager has counter logic
- **NO integration test** validates counters work with real event emissions

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Counter increment not tested end-to-end:**
   - Do counters properly increment from 0→1→2→3?
   - What happens if same evidence collected twice?
   - Are counters preserved across objective updates?

2. **UI display of counters not tested:**
   - Does "(0/3)" text update in real-time?
   - What if event fires before UI subscribes?

3. **Edge case: Counter overflow:**
   - What happens if 4 pieces of evidence collected when objective needs 3?
   - Does objective complete at 3 or wait for exactly 3?

**Player Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Players expect progress bars to work. Broken counters = confusion.

**Testing Priority:** HIGH - Should test in Sprint 8.

---

### 2.4 ❌ HIGH: Quest UI Components (ZERO TESTS)

**Evidence:**
- 3 quest UI components implemented:
  - `QuestNotification.js` - Toast notifications
  - `QuestTrackerHUD.js` - On-screen objective tracker
  - `QuestLogUI.js` - Full quest log overlay
- **NO test files found** for any quest UI components
- Unit test coverage threshold: 60% for game code, but UI has 0%

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **QuestNotification rendering and timing:**
   - Do notifications fade in/out correctly (500ms fade, 4s display)?
   - Does notification queue work (multiple quests starting)?
   - Do notifications overlap or stack properly?

2. **QuestTrackerHUD auto-tracking:**
   - Does tracker auto-add main quests on start?
   - Does tracker show up to 5 active objectives?
   - Does tracker clear completed objectives?
   - Does tracker update in real-time as objectives complete?

3. **QuestLogUI tab system:**
   - Can player switch between Active/Completed/Failed tabs?
   - Does quest list update when tab changes?
   - Does detail panel show correct quest info?
   - Does 'Q' key toggle properly?

4. **Responsive positioning:**
   - Do UI components handle canvas resize?
   - Are magic numbers (canvas width - 420) safe?

**Player Impact:** MEDIUM - UI bugs = annoying but not blocking.

**Testing Priority:** MEDIUM - Should add tests in Sprint 8 polish phase.

---

### 2.5 ⚠️ MEDIUM: Tutorial Integration with Quest System (NOT TESTED)

**Evidence:**
- TutorialSystem exists and has comprehensive tests
- Quest 001 is designed as tutorial quest
- **NO integration test** validates tutorial + quest interaction

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Tutorial step → Quest objective alignment:**
   - Do tutorial steps properly trigger quest objectives?
   - What if player skips tutorial but quest expects tutorial completion?

2. **Tutorial completion → Quest auto-start:**
   - Does Case 001 auto-start immediately on game begin?
   - Does auto-start wait for tutorial completion?
   - What if player loads save with tutorial incomplete?

3. **Tutorial UI + Quest UI overlap:**
   - Do tutorial popups overlap quest notifications?
   - Can player open quest log during tutorial?
   - Does quest tracker show during tutorial?

**Player Impact:** MEDIUM - First 15 minutes define player retention.

**Testing Priority:** MEDIUM - Should validate in Sprint 8.

---

### 2.6 ⚠️ MEDIUM: Ability Unlock Flow (UNCLEAR DESIGN)

**Evidence from Playtest Report:**
> "Quest 001 objective 5 unlocks 'detective vision' but reward grants 'memory_trace'"

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Objective 5 vs Reward mismatch:**
   - Objective: "Learn to use Detective Vision" (trigger: `ability:unlocked` `detective_vision`)
   - Reward: `abilityUnlock: 'memory_trace'`
   - Which ability unlocks when?

2. **Ability unlock timing:**
   - Does detective vision unlock mid-quest?
   - Does memory trace unlock at quest completion?
   - Can player use detective vision before objective 5?

3. **No test validates ability unlock triggers quest objective:**
   - Does `ability:unlocked` event properly fire?
   - Does QuestSystem listen for ability events?

**Player Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM - Confusing ability progression could frustrate players.

**Testing Priority:** LOW - Should clarify design and add test.

---

### 2.7 ⚠️ LOW: Dialogue Error Handling (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Evidence from Playtest Report:**
> "No error handling when DialogueSystem tries to start unregistered dialogue"

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Silent failure on missing dialogue:**
   - If NPC tries to start dialogue that doesn't exist, no error logged
   - Player might click NPC and nothing happens

2. **No validation of dialogue prerequisites:**
   - Can player start dialogue before quest starts?
   - Can player restart completed dialogues?

**Player Impact:** LOW - Only affects edge cases or dev bugs.

**Testing Priority:** LOW - Add error logging in polish phase.

---

### 2.8 ⚠️ LOW: Keyboard Navigation for Quest Log (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Evidence from Playtest Report:**
> "Add keyboard navigation to quest log (arrows, tab, enter)"

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **No arrow key navigation in quest list**
2. **No tab key to switch tabs**
3. **No enter key to close**

**Player Impact:** LOW - Mouse navigation works, keyboard is nice-to-have.

**Testing Priority:** LOW - Post-vertical slice polish.

---

## 3. Player Experience Research: Detective Game First 30 Minutes

### Research Question
What makes a compelling first 30 minutes in a detective game? How should tutorial and quest onboarding work?

### Key Findings from Industry Research

#### General Game Onboarding Best Practices (2024)

**FTUE (First Time User Experience) Timing:**
- First **60 seconds:** Critical for retention
- First **15 minutes:** Show core gameplay loop and convince players to continue
- First **7 days:** Gradual system introduction for long-term retention

**Core Principles:**
1. **Keep It Focused:** Hide UI and systems not needed in first 15 minutes
2. **Quick Engagement:** Show core loop immediately, don't delay fun
3. **Interactive Learning:** Players learn by doing (kinesthetic learning)
4. **First Win:** Ensure players feel rewarded in first few minutes
5. **Limit Feature Introduction:** Focus on 3-5 core features, introduce rest later

**Onboarding Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Front-loading all features in tutorial
- ❌ Long text explanations before gameplay
- ❌ Complex menus before player understands basics
- ❌ Overwhelming with too many systems upfront

#### Detective Game Tutorial Design Philosophy

**Return of the Obra Dinn Approach (Minimal Hand-Holding):**
- "Puzzle and mystery games thrive when they stay out of the player's way"
- Minimal initial information: 2 tools (logbook, watch) + basic crew list
- **No dialogue hints** that become available after discovering items
- Players solve purely through observation and deduction
- **Hands-off design:** Game provides tools, player figures out the rest

**Disco Elysium Approach (Narrative-Driven):**
- Linear story progression with embedded tutorials
- Players learn by following story and interacting with everything
- Less emphasis on pure deduction, more on exploration and dialogue
- **Guided discovery:** Clear objectives lead players through systems

**Design Spectrum:**
- **High Immersion** (Obra Dinn): Thin wall between player and detective, player IS detective
- **Medium Immersion** (LA Noire): Player guides detective, clear objectives
- **Low Immersion** (Disco Elysium): Player experiences story, deduction is secondary

**Recommendation for The Memory Syndicate:**
- Aim for **Medium-High Immersion** (detective metroidvania hybrid)
- Provide tools and clear objectives (like Obra Dinn)
- But guide discovery through quest structure (like LA Noire)
- Avoid excessive hand-holding, let player feel smart

#### Quest Notification UI Best Practices (2024)

**Key Principles:**
1. **Quest Logs as Journals:** Track adventures without overwhelming
2. **Robust Quest Trackers:** Multiple objectives without feeling cluttered
3. **Quest States:** Active, targeted (next step shown), blocked, completed
4. **Discoverability:** Users struggle when quests buried in complex menus
5. **Interactive Feedback:** Clear visual/audio feedback on quest updates

**Modern Design Trends:**
- **AI-Driven Notifications:** Analyze player behavior, adjust notification timing
- **Micro-Interactions:** Polish through animations, sound effects on updates
- **Consistency:** Similar layouts across all menus for quick orientation
- **Mobile-First Thinking:** 3-5 steps maximum, quick onboarding

**Quest Notification Design Patterns:**
- Toast notifications (top-right): 3-5 seconds display
- On-screen tracker (side HUD): Persistent, shows 3-5 active objectives
- Full quest log (overlay): Accessed via hotkey, shows all quests
- Mini-map markers: Show next objective location

## 4. Current Act 1 Quest Flow Validation

### Quest Structure Review

**Quest 001: "The Hollow Case" (Tutorial Quest)**
- **Objectives:** 9 (good tutorial pacing)
- **Teaches:** Evidence collection, detective vision, deduction board, forensics, interviews
- **Auto-start:** ✅ Yes (good for FTUE)
- **Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes
- **Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent tutorial structure

**Quest 002: "Following the Pattern" (Branching Quest)**
- **Objectives:** 6 with 1 optional
- **Teaches:** Optional objectives, player agency
- **Branches:** Based on optional objective completion
- **Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes
- **Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ Good, but branching needs testing

**Quest 003: "Memory Parlor" (Infiltration Quest)**
- **Objectives:** 7
- **Teaches:** Stealth, disguise system
- **Genre Blend:** Detective + Stealth (core hybrid mechanic)
- **Estimated Time:** 25-30 minutes
- **Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent genre-blend showcase

**Quest 004: "Informant Network" (NPC Relationship Quest)**
- **Objectives:** 5
- **Teaches:** Faction reputation, NPC relationships
- **Count-Based:** Recruit 3 informants (needs testing)
- **Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes
- **Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ Good, but count trigger needs validation

**Quest 005: "The Memory Drive" (Act 1 Climax)**
- **Objectives:** 6
- **Teaches:** Act transitions, branching consequences
- **Branching Dialogue:** Trust Reese or not (impacts Act 2)
- **Estimated Time:** 20-25 minutes
- **Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent climax with meaningful choices

### Act 1 Total Playtime Estimate
**Total:** 95-125 minutes (1.5-2 hours)
**Target:** 2-3 hours stated in quest file
**Assessment:** ✅ Realistic pacing for first act

### First 30 Minutes Analysis

**Player Experience Timeline:**
- **0-5 min:** Game start → Captain Reese briefing (dialogue) → Quest 001 auto-starts
- **5-15 min:** Arrive at crime scene → Examine body → Collect 3 evidence
- **15-25 min:** Interview witness → Unlock detective vision → Find hidden evidence
- **25-35 min:** Analyze neural extractor → Connect clues on deduction board
- **35-40 min:** Report findings to Captain Reese → Quest 001 complete

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Shows core detective loop in first 15 minutes
- ✅ Introduces 5 core mechanics (evidence, interviews, vision, deduction, forensics)
- ✅ Emotional hook (partner Alex is victim)
- ✅ Ends with reward (memory trace ability unlock)
- ⚠️ Potential issue: 9 objectives might feel overwhelming in tracker HUD

**Comparison to Best Practices:**
- ✅ Quick engagement (crime scene immediately)
- ✅ Interactive learning (do, don't tell)
- ✅ First win (complete first objective in 5 minutes)
- ✅ Focused (all objectives teach detective loop)
- ⚠️ Risk: Too many mechanics in 30 minutes? (5 systems)

**Recommendation:**
- Consider hiding some UI elements until needed:
  - Don't show deduction board UI until objective 8
  - Don't show full quest log until tutorial complete
  - Auto-track Quest 001, don't let player untrack during tutorial

## 5. Critical Gaps That MUST Be Addressed in Sprint 8

### Priority 1: SHOWSTOPPERS (Must Fix Before Release)

#### 1. Save/Load System Validation
**Why:** Players expect saves to work. Broken saves = lost progress.

**Testing Approach:**
- **Manual Playtest:**
  1. Start new game → Complete Quest 001 halfway (5/9 objectives)
  2. Trigger autosave (quest:objective_completed event)
  3. Reload page → Load autosave
  4. Verify: Quest 001 still active, 5 objectives complete, counters preserved
  5. Complete Quest 001 → Quest 002 auto-starts
  6. Save manually to slot "test_save_1"
  7. Reload → Load "test_save_1"
  8. Verify: Quest 002 active, Quest 001 in completed tab

- **Automated Test (if time permits):**
  - Unit test: QuestManager.serialize() / deserialize()
  - Unit test: SaveManager.saveGame() / loadGame()
  - Integration test: Full save/load cycle with quest state

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (2h manual test, 2-4h automated tests)

---

#### 2. Quest Branch Logic Validation
**Why:** Branching is core to player agency. Broken branches = blocked progression.

**Testing Approach:**
- **Manual Playtest Path A (Complete Optional Objective):**
  1. Complete Quest 001
  2. Start Quest 002
  3. Complete optional objective: Meet informant Jax
  4. Complete Quest 002 (set flag: `case_002_solved`)
  5. Verify: Quest 003 "Memory Parlor" auto-starts (NOT Quest 004)

- **Manual Playtest Path B (Skip Optional Objective):**
  1. Complete Quest 001
  2. Start Quest 002
  3. Skip optional objective (don't meet Jax)
  4. Complete Quest 002
  5. Verify: Quest 004 "Informant Network" auto-starts (NOT Quest 003)
  6. Complete Quest 004
  7. Verify: Quest 003 auto-starts after Quest 004

- **Code Review:**
  - Verify QuestManager.evaluateBranch() supports `obj_optional_informant: true` syntax
  - If not, convert to story flag: `informant_jax_recruited`

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours (2h manual test both paths, 1-2h code fix if needed)

---

#### 3. Count-Based Objective Triggers Validation
**Why:** Progress bars must work. Broken counters = player confusion.

**Testing Approach:**
- **Manual Playtest:**
  1. Start Quest 001
  2. Collect evidence piece 1 → Verify UI shows "(1/3)"
  3. Collect evidence piece 2 → Verify UI shows "(2/3)"
  4. Collect evidence piece 3 → Verify objective completes, UI updates
  5. Repeat for detective vision evidence (0/5 → 5/5)

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Collect 4 pieces when objective needs 3 (overflow)
  - Collect duplicate evidence (should not double-count)
  - Trigger counter event before quest starts (should not count)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours (manual testing with debug logging)

---

### Priority 2: IMPORTANT (Should Fix)

#### 4. Quest UI Component Tests
**Why:** UI bugs are annoying and hurt polish.

**Testing Approach:**
- **Unit Tests (Add to test suite):**
  - QuestNotification: Test fade animations, queue system
  - QuestTrackerHUD: Test auto-tracking, objective updates
  - QuestLogUI: Test tab switching, quest list updates

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (2h per component)

---

#### 5. Tutorial + Quest Integration Validation
**Why:** First 15 minutes define retention.

**Testing Approach:**
- **Manual Playtest:**
  1. Start new game (tutorial enabled)
  2. Verify: Tutorial starts, Quest 001 auto-starts
  3. Complete tutorial steps
  4. Verify: Tutorial UI doesn't overlap quest notifications
  5. Verify: Quest tracker shows during tutorial
  6. Press 'Q' during tutorial → Verify quest log opens

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours (manual playtest)

---

### Priority 3: NICE-TO-HAVE (Polish)

#### 6. Ability Unlock Flow Clarification
**Why:** Confusing ability progression hurts immersion.

**Testing Approach:**
- **Design Review:** Clarify detective vision vs memory trace timing
- **Test:** Verify ability unlocks trigger quest objectives

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour (design clarification + test)

---

#### 7. Dialogue Error Handling
**Why:** Better dev experience and player experience.

**Testing Approach:**
- Add console.error when dialogue doesn't exist
- Add console.warn when dialogue prerequisites not met

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes (add logging)

---

#### 8. Keyboard Navigation for Quest Log
**Why:** Accessibility and convenience.

**Testing Approach:**
- Add arrow key navigation (post-vertical slice)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours (implementation + testing)

---

## 6. Recommended Testing Approach for Sprint 8

### Phase 1: Critical Gap Testing (Day 1-2)

**Manual Live Playtest (Priority):**
1. ✅ Fix any remaining bugs from session-11
2. 🎮 **Run npm run dev → Play through full Act 1 (2 hours)**
3. Test checklist:
   - [ ] Quest 001 auto-starts on game begin
   - [ ] All 9 objectives complete in sequence
   - [ ] Dialogue interactions work (Reese, witness)
   - [ ] Detective vision unlocks and works
   - [ ] Deduction board accepts clue connections
   - [ ] Quest 001 completes, Quest 002 auto-starts
   - [ ] Save game mid-quest → Reload → Verify state preserved
   - [ ] Complete optional objective in Quest 002 → Verify Quest 003 starts
   - [ ] Start new game, skip optional objective → Verify Quest 004 starts
   - [ ] Complete all 5 quests through to Act 1 conclusion
   - [ ] Verify story flags set correctly
   - [ ] Verify faction reputation changes

**Why Manual Testing First:**
- Fastest way to find integration bugs
- Validates player experience (feel, pacing, polish)
- Identifies edge cases for automated tests
- Required for UX feedback

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours (2 playthroughs with note-taking)

---

### Phase 2: Automated Test Coverage (Day 2-3)

**Add Missing Tests:**
1. SaveManager unit tests (serialize/deserialize)
2. Quest branch integration tests
3. Count-based trigger integration tests
4. Quest UI component tests (if time permits)

**Why Automated Tests:**
- Prevent regression in future sprints
- Faster iteration (don't need manual playthrough every time)
- Validate edge cases difficult to test manually

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours (1-2h per test suite)

---

### Phase 3: E2E Test Setup (Day 3-4, Optional)

**Playwright E2E Test:**
- Playwright already installed (`npm run test:e2e`)
- **NO E2E tests exist yet**
- Consider adding 1-2 E2E smoke tests:
  1. "Can start game and complete first quest objective"
  2. "Can open quest log and view active quests"

**Why E2E Tests:**
- Validates full stack (UI + systems + rendering)
- Catches browser-specific bugs
- Confidence for future releases

**Why Optional:**
- E2E tests slow to write and run
- Manual playtest covers most issues
- Can defer to post-vertical slice

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours (setup + 2 basic tests)

---

## 7. UX/UI Polish Opportunities

### High-Impact Polish (Should Do)

#### 1. Quest Auto-Start Feedback
**Current:** Quest auto-starts silently
**Issue:** Player doesn't know quest started
**Solution:** Add quest notification or tutorial prompt on auto-start

**Example:**
```
[QuestNotification appears top-right]
"New Quest: The Hollow Case"
"Investigate your partner's death"
[Fades after 4 seconds]
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour (already have notification system)

---

#### 2. First-Time Quest Log Prompt
**Current:** Player must discover 'Q' key
**Issue:** Players might not know quest log exists
**Solution:** Show tutorial prompt after Quest 001 auto-starts

**Example:**
```
[Tutorial overlay]
"Press 'Q' to open your quest log"
[Highlight 'Q' key icon]
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours (add tutorial step)

---

#### 3. Objective Counter Visual Polish
**Current:** Text only "(0/3)"
**Issue:** Text-only counters feel dated
**Solution:** Add progress bar or icon fill animation

**Example:**
```
Collect evidence (2/3)
[■■□] 66%
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours (add progress bar rendering)

---

#### 4. Quest Completion Celebration
**Current:** Notification only
**Issue:** Completing quest feels anticlimactic
**Solution:** Add sound effect + screen flash + reward popup

**Example:**
```
[Screen flashes gold]
[Sound: Quest complete chime]
[Popup shows rewards]
"Quest Complete: The Hollow Case"
"Ability Unlocked: Memory Trace"
"Police Reputation +10"
[Press any key to continue]
```

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours (add celebration UI)

---

### Medium-Impact Polish (Nice to Have)

#### 5. Quest Tracker Position Customization
**Current:** Fixed position (canvas width - 320, y: 120)
**Issue:** Might overlap other UI on small screens
**Solution:** Make tracker draggable or add position presets

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

#### 6. Quest Log Search/Filter
**Current:** Show all quests in list
**Issue:** As quests grow, list becomes cluttered
**Solution:** Add search bar or quest type filter

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

#### 7. Quest Difficulty Indicators
**Current:** No difficulty shown
**Issue:** Player doesn't know quest difficulty
**Solution:** Add stars or level indicators

**Example:**
```
[★★★☆☆] Case 001: The Hollow Case (Tutorial)
[★★★★☆] Case 003: Memory Parlor (Challenging)
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

---

### Low-Impact Polish (Post-Vertical Slice)

#### 8. Animated Quest Markers
**Current:** Static objective text
**Solution:** Add pulsing or glowing effect on active objective

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

#### 9. Quest Journal Flavor Text
**Current:** Quest log shows objectives only
**Solution:** Add optional "journal entry" text for immersion

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours implementation + content writing

---

#### 10. Quest History Timeline
**Current:** Completed quests show in list
**Solution:** Add visual timeline showing quest completion order

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

**Total Estimated Effort:** 12-18 hours (1.5-2 days)

---

### SHOULD DO for Polish (Sprint 8)

6. **Add Quest UI Component Tests (4-6 hours)**
   - QuestNotification, QuestTrackerHUD, QuestLogUI tests

7. **Add Quest Auto-Start Feedback (1 hour)**
   - Show notification when quest starts

8. **Add First-Time Quest Log Prompt (1-2 hours)**
   - Tutorial prompt to press 'Q'

9. **Clarify Ability Unlock Flow (1 hour)**
   - Fix detective vision vs memory trace confusion

10. **Add Dialogue Error Handling (30 min)**
    - Console errors for missing dialogues

**Total Estimated Effort:** 7-10 hours (1 day)

### COULD DO Post-Vertical Slice

11. **E2E Test Setup (4-6 hours)**
    - Playwright smoke tests for Act 1

12. **Quest Completion Celebration (3-4 hours)**
    - Reward popup with animations

13. **Objective Counter Visual Polish (2-3 hours)**
    - Progress bars instead of text counters

14. **Keyboard Navigation (2-3 hours)**
    - Arrow keys, tab, enter for quest log

**Total Estimated Effort:** 11-16 hours (1.5-2 days)

## 10. Testing Effort Summary

| Priority | Tasks | Estimated Time |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **CRITICAL (Must Do)** | Manual playtest + critical bug fixes + tests | 12-18 hours |
| **HIGH (Should Do)** | UI tests + UX polish + error handling | 7-10 hours |
| **MEDIUM (Could Do)** | E2E tests + animations + keyboard nav | 11-16 hours |
| **TOTAL** | Full Act 1 testing + polish | **30-44 hours** |

### Sprint 8 Recommendation

**Focus on CRITICAL tasks only:** 12-18 hours (1.5-2 days)
- Manual playtest to find issues
- Fix critical bugs (save/load, branching)
- Add essential tests to prevent regression

**If time permits, add HIGH tasks:** +7-10 hours (1 day)
- UI component tests
- Basic UX polish (notifications, prompts)

**Defer MEDIUM tasks to post-vertical slice:**
- E2E tests can wait
- Advanced polish can wait
- Keyboard nav can wait

## 11. Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Could Block Release)

1. **Save/Load Broken**
   - **Risk:** Players lose progress, game unplayable
   - **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (implemented but untested)
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL (showstopper)
   - **Mitigation:** Manual playtest ASAP

2. **Quest Branching Broken**
   - **Risk:** Players can't progress past Quest 002
   - **Likelihood:** LOW-MEDIUM (logic unclear)
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL (showstopper)
   - **Mitigation:** Manual playtest both paths

3. **Count-Based Triggers Broken**
   - **Risk:** Objectives never complete, players stuck
   - **Likelihood:** LOW (logic seems sound)
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL (showstopper)
   - **Mitigation:** Manual playtest Quest 001

---

### Medium Risk (Hurts Experience)

4. **Too Many Systems in First 30 Minutes**
   - **Risk:** Players feel overwhelmed, quit early
   - **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (5 systems is a lot)
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM (hurts retention)
   - **Mitigation:** Watch playtest feedback, consider hiding UI

5. **Quest Log Discoverability**
   - **Risk:** Players don't know quest log exists
   - **Likelihood:** HIGH (no prompt to press 'Q')
   - **Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM (annoying but not blocking)
   - **Mitigation:** Add tutorial prompt

6. **Ability Unlock Confusion**
   - **Risk:** Players don't understand when abilities unlock
   - **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (design unclear)
   - **Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM (confusing but not blocking)
   - **Mitigation:** Clarify design, add feedback

---

### Low Risk (Polish Issues)

7. **UI Components Not Tested**
   - **Risk:** Visual bugs in notifications/tracker
   - **Likelihood:** LOW (code looks solid)
   - **Impact:** LOW (annoying but not blocking)
   - **Mitigation:** Add tests when time permits

8. **No Keyboard Navigation**
   - **Risk:** Accessibility issue
   - **Likelihood:** N/A (not implemented)
   - **Impact:** LOW (nice to have)
   - **Mitigation:** Post-vertical slice

---

## 12. Conclusion

Act 1 is **architecturally excellent** (95% ready) but has **significant playtest gaps** that could hide critical bugs. The quest system is well-designed, dialogue is compelling, and UI is functional, but **zero live playtesting** means we don't know if it actually works end-to-end.

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. ✅ **Manual live playtest** (MANDATORY before calling Act 1 "complete")
2. ✅ **Test save/load** (CRITICAL - players expect saves to work)
3. ✅ **Test quest branching** (CRITICAL - core to player agency)
4. ✅ **Add regression tests** (IMPORTANT - prevent future breaks)

**Estimated Sprint 8 Effort:** 12-18 hours for critical validation + 7-10 hours for polish = **19-28 hours total** (2.5-3.5 days)

**Confidence Level:**
- **Before Manual Playtest:** 60% confident (architecture good, but untested)
- **After Manual Playtest + Critical Tests:** 90% confident (validated + regression-proof)

**Recommendation:** Dedicate first half of Sprint 8 to **testing and validation** before adding new features. A solid, tested Act 1 is better than a rushed, buggy Act 1 with more content.
