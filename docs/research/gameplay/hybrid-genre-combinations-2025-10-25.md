## Design Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Dual-Loop Hybrid
**Description**: Two distinct gameplay loops that feed into each other

**When to Use**: When genres have complementary rhythms (fast/slow, tactical/reflex)

**Example Implementation**:
- Loop A: Fast-paced action (dungeon runs, combat encounters)
- Loop B: Strategic management (base building, investigation, relationship building)
- Integration: Loop A provides resources/information for Loop B; Loop B provides upgrades/story for Loop A

**Pros**:
- Natural pacing variation prevents fatigue
- Appeals to different player motivations
- Persistent progression between procedural runs
- Easy to create narrative hooks in slower loop

**Cons**:
- Risk of one loop feeling like "chore" to access the other
- Balancing two systems increases complexity
- Players may prefer one loop over the other

### Pattern 2: Constraint-Based Fusion
**Description**: One genre adds constraint/twist to another's core mechanics

**When to Use**: When you want a unique mechanical identity that differentiates from similar games

**Example Implementation**:
- Base genre: Roguelike dungeon crawler
- Constraint: Rhythm/timing requirement, resource scarcity, time pressure, stealth requirements
- Result: Core mechanics remain recognizable but constraint creates novel skill requirement

**Pros**:
- Creates unique identity
- Constraint often increases tension and engagement
- Can simplify some aspects while adding depth to others
- Procedural generation works well with constraints

**Cons**:
- Constraint may alienate players who dislike that mechanic
- Harder to balance (constraint can break difficulty curve)
- Requires tight implementation to avoid frustration

### Pattern 3: Narrative-Mechanical Integration
**Description**: Story systems ARE gameplay systems, not separate layers

**When to Use**: When narrative depth is a core pillar alongside mechanical complexity

**Example Implementation**:
- Investigation mechanics that reveal world lore
- Relationship systems that gate content/abilities
- Faction reputation affecting procedural encounters
- Choice-driven branching that alters mechanical rules

**Pros**:
- Story and gameplay reinforce each other
- Player choices feel mechanically meaningful
- Natural world-building through gameplay
- High replayability from branching

**Cons**:
- Complex to design and balance
- Requires significant content creation
- Story state tracking increases technical complexity
- Risk of narrative railroading if not careful

### Pattern 4: Emergent Storytelling Framework
**Description**: Minimal authored content, maximum mechanical systems that generate narrative

**When to Use**: When procedural generation extends to story, not just levels

**Example Implementation**:
- Character trait systems that affect behavior
- Faction dynamics with procedural relationships
- Event systems that respond to world state
- Memory systems that track player actions and consequences

**Pros**:
- Infinite replayability
- Stories feel personal and unique
- Lower content creation burden after systems built
- Procedural generation natural fit

**Cons**:
- Risk of shallow/repetitive "stories"
- Harder to create memorable moments
- Requires robust simulation systems
- Quality control difficult
