## 1. Knowledge-Gated Progression ("Metroidbrainia")

### Overview
Progression system where player knowledge—not items or stat increases—unlocks new areas and possibilities. The world is open from the start, but routes and solutions remain opaque until players learn the rules, patterns, or secrets.

### Core Mechanics
- **Pure Knowledge Gates:** Puzzles solvable only through understanding game systems (e.g., Outer Wilds, Tunic)
- **Hybrid Knowledge + Item Gates:** Metroidvania-style gating where abilities teach you possibilities, but execution requires player skill/knowledge
- **Environmental Storytelling Integration:** Lore clues scattered through the world hint at solutions and deepen narrative

### Narrative Integration Opportunities
- Story beats unlock not through combat/collection, but through discovering truths about the world
- Player's understanding of factions, history, or cosmology directly enables access to new areas
- Failed attempts contribute to knowledge accumulation (Disco Elysium's failure-as-content approach)
- Quest progression tied to piecing together information from multiple sources

### Technical Considerations (JS + Canvas + ECS)
**Performance Impact:** Low
**Implementation Complexity:** Medium

- Store player knowledge state in persistent component (discoveries, revealed rules, decoded languages)
- Event bus can broadcast knowledge acquisition to gate systems
- Minimal rendering overhead—primarily logic-driven
- Can reuse existing collision/pathfinding systems with conditional access based on knowledge flags

**ECS Integration:**
```javascript
// Components
KnowledgeComponent: { discoveries: Set, rules: Map, secrets: Array }
GateComponent: { requiredKnowledge: Array, alternativeSolutions: Array }

// System
KnowledgeGateSystem: Checks player knowledge against gate requirements
```

### Genre Compatibility
- **Excellent for:** Mystery/Investigation + Action-Adventure, Puzzle-Platformer + RPG
- **Moderate for:** Roguelite (knowledge carries between runs), Metroidvania (hybrid approach)
- **Poor for:** Pure arcade, beat-em-up (minimal narrative depth)

### Implementation Notes
- Requires robust hint system to prevent frustration
- UI should track discoveries without spoiling solutions
- Balance between "aha!" moments and obscurity
- Consider multiple solution paths for accessibility

### Examples
- **Outer Wilds:** 22-minute time loops where only knowledge persists
- **Tunic:** In-game manual pages reveal hidden mechanics and language
- **La-Mulana:** Dense knowledge requirements with cryptic environmental clues

## 2. Dynamic Faction Reputation System

### Overview
Dual-axis reputation tracking (Fame/Infamy) with multiple factions whose relationships with the player and each other create emergent political dynamics, affecting world state, available quests, and NPC behavior.

### Core Mechanics
- **Dual-Axis Tracking:** Separate Fame (positive) and Infamy (negative) values per faction
- **Cascading Consequences:** Helping one faction may alienate their enemies
- **World State Changes:** Faction control over territories shifts based on player actions and inter-faction warfare
- **Disguise Systems:** Wearing faction gear temporarily overrides reputation
- **Dynamic Quest Availability:** Quests appear/disappear based on reputation thresholds

### Narrative Integration Opportunities
- Player choices in dialogue and combat have immediate reputation consequences
- Branching storylines where certain endings are locked behind faction alliances
- Companion reactions tied to faction reputation (some may leave if you betray their faction)
- Environmental changes (faction banners, patrols, safe houses) reflect power shifts
- Assassination attempts or rewards based on reputation extremes

### Technical Considerations (JS + Canvas + ECS)
**Performance Impact:** Low-Medium
**Implementation Complexity:** Medium-High

- Store reputation as numeric values per faction in player component
- Event-driven reputation changes broadcast through event bus
- NPC behavior systems query reputation before dialogue/combat
- Territory control can use simple zone ownership flags
- Assassin spawning system triggers on reputation thresholds

**ECS Integration:**
```javascript
// Components
ReputationComponent: { factions: Map<FactionID, {fame, infamy}> }
FactionComponent: { factionID, relations: Map<FactionID, relationship> }
TerritoryComponent: { controllingFaction, contestedBy }

// Systems
ReputationSystem: Tracks and updates reputation based on events
FactionAISystem: NPCs behave according to player reputation
TerritoryControlSystem: Updates zone ownership based on faction strength
```

### Genre Compatibility
- **Excellent for:** RPG + Action, Open-World + Strategy, Stealth + Diplomacy
- **Moderate for:** Roguelite (persistent reputation between runs?), Metroidvania
- **Poor for:** Linear narrative games, pure puzzle games

### Implementation Notes
- Start with 3-5 factions for manageable complexity
- Clearly telegraph reputation changes to player
- Balance so no faction is clearly "best" choice
- Allow reputation recovery (slowly) to prevent permanent lockouts
- Faction relationships should shift dynamically (allies can become enemies)

### Examples
- **Fallout: New Vegas:** Gold standard for faction systems with cascading consequences
- **Dragon Age: Origins:** Origin-based reactions from NPCs and factions
- **Mount & Blade 2:** Dynamic territorial control and shifting allegiances

## 3. Emergent Narrative Simulation (AI Storyteller)

### Overview
Story moments generated through simulation of character needs, relationships, environmental events, and random incidents—rather than scripted sequences. An AI Storyteller algorithm monitors game state and injects events to maintain dramatic pacing.

### Core Mechanics
- **Character Autonomy:** NPCs have stats, needs, relationships, and emotional states that drive behavior
- **Event Database:** Categorized pool of possible events (raids, visitors, disasters, opportunities)
- **Pacing Algorithm:** AI Storyteller monitors tension curve and injects events at appropriate times
- **Player Agency + Unpredictability:** Player has many options, but random events challenge them in unexpected ways
- **Abstraction as Asset:** Simple graphics encourage player imagination to fill narrative gaps

### Narrative Integration Opportunities
- Overarching plot provides direction, but moment-to-moment stories emerge from simulation
- NPC relationships create organic drama (rivalries, friendships, betrayals)
- Environmental hazards and resource scarcity create tension without scripted events
- Player failures become story beats rather than pure punishment
- Multiple playthroughs yield radically different stories

### Technical Considerations (JS + Canvas + ECS)
**Performance Impact:** Medium
**Implementation Complexity:** High

- Lightweight AI for character autonomy (needs-based behavior trees)
- Event system already required for ECS can drive storyteller
- Relationship tracking requires graph structure (can be sparse)
- Pacing algorithm evaluates tension metrics periodically (not every frame)
- Event injection should feel natural, not artificial

**ECS Integration:**
```javascript
// Components
CharacterStatsComponent: { hunger, energy, stress, mood }
RelationshipComponent: { targetID, opinion, history: Array }
EventHistoryComponent: { recentEvents: Queue, tensionLevel }

// Systems
CharacterNeedsSystem: Updates autonomy based on needs
RelationshipSystem: Tracks and evolves NPC relationships
StorytellerSystem: Monitors pacing and injects events
```

### Genre Compatibility
- **Excellent for:** Colony/Base Management + Action, Survival + RPG, Strategy + Narrative
- **Moderate for:** Roguelite (run-based stories), Open-World Action
- **Poor for:** Tightly scripted narratives, pure action games

### Implementation Notes
- Start simple: 5-10 character needs, 20-30 event types
- Clearly communicate NPC emotional states to player (icons, dialogue)
- Balance simulation depth vs. performance (update character AI infrequently)
- Provide player tools to influence but not completely control NPC behavior
- Log major events for player to review their emergent story

### Examples
- **RimWorld:** AI Storyteller adjusts event frequency/severity based on colony state
- **Dwarf Fortress:** Deep simulation creates legendary emergent stories
- **Crusader Kings 3:** Character traits and relationships drive emergent drama

## 4. Hybrid Build Customization (Synergy Systems)

### Overview
Deep build diversity through modular systems (cards, abilities, items, mutations) that create powerful synergies when combined correctly. Players experiment to discover optimal combinations rather than following prescribed paths.

### Core Mechanics
- **Modular Components:** Cards, abilities, equipment, perks that can be mixed freely
- **Emergent Synergies:** Combinations create effects greater than sum of parts
- **Discovery-Driven:** Players experiment to find powerful interactions
- **Generosity + Diversity:** Abundant tools to encourage creative expression
- **Build-Defining Items:** Rare items/cards that enable entirely new playstyles
- **Deck/Loadout Thinning:** Mechanisms to remove weak options and refine builds

### Narrative Integration Opportunities
- Build choices reflect character personality (stealthy diplomat vs. aggressive berserker)
- Story branches acknowledge player's playstyle ("You're known as a shadow" vs. "Your reputation precedes you")
- Factions offer unique build options tied to their philosophy
- Quests designed with multiple solution paths suited to different builds
- Late-game bosses require specific counters, encouraging build adaptation

### Technical Considerations (JS + Canvas + ECS)
**Performance Impact:** Medium
**Implementation Complexity:** Medium-High

- Build system naturally fits ECS (components are build pieces)
- Effect stacking requires order-of-operations clarity
- Synergy detection can happen during component addition/removal (one-time cost)
- Cache calculated stats to avoid per-frame recalculation
- Object pooling for temporary effect entities

**ECS Integration:**
```javascript
// Components
AbilityComponent: { abilityID, modifiers, cooldown }
EquipmentComponent: { slots: Map, bonuses: Array }
SynergyComponent: { activesynergies: Set, bonusesgrated }
StatModifierComponent: { base, multipliers, additions }

// Systems
SynergyDetectionSystem: Identifies active synergies when build changes
StatCalculationSystem: Computes final stats from all modifiers
AbilitySystem: Executes abilities with synergy bonuses applied
```

### Genre Compatibility
- **Excellent for:** Roguelite + Deckbuilder, Action-RPG, Metroidvania + RPG
- **Moderate for:** Puzzle-Platformer (ability synergies), Beat-em-up (combo systems)
- **Poor for:** Pure narrative games, simple arcade games

### Implementation Notes
- Start with 30-50 modular pieces for minimum viable diversity
- Design "build-around" pieces that enable new strategies
- Balance so many builds are viable (avoid single dominant strategy)
- UI should clearly show active synergies and stat calculations
- Provide respec/rebuild options to encourage experimentation
- Tag system helps players identify potential synergies

### Examples
- **Slay the Spire:** Deep card synergies with distinct character builds
- **Hades:** Boon combinations create powerful emergent effects
- **Griftlands:** Dual deck systems (combat + negotiation) with cross-synergies
- **Wildfrost:** Generous tools encourage creative expressions

## 5. Procedural Generation with Authored Constraints

### Overview
Algorithmic level/world generation constrained by authored rules, themes, and narrative beats—combining variety of procedural systems with intentionality of hand-crafted design. Wave Function Collapse and similar techniques generate worlds that feel designed.

### Core Mechanics
- **Wave Function Collapse (WFC):** Generate patterns from sample tiles/modules with adjacency rules
- **Constraint-Based Generation:** Author defines rules; algorithm fills in details
- **Narrative Anchors:** Key story locations are hand-placed; connective tissue is procedural
- **Biome Systems:** Different rulesets create distinct regions with unique aesthetics
- **Emergent Layouts:** Interactions between modules create interesting spaces unexpectedly
- **Iterative Refinement:** Multiple passes add details (structure, then decoration, then population)

### Narrative Integration Opportunities
- Procedural dungeons connect hand-crafted story hubs (hybrid approach)
- Lore-appropriate enemies/items spawn in contextually correct locations
- Environmental storytelling through authored tile relationships (ruins, overgrowth, destruction)
- Side quest locations generated procedurally but populated with narrative context
- Player knowledge of biome rules becomes gameplay mechanic (enemy types, hazards)

### Technical Considerations (JS + Canvas + ECS)
**Performance Impact:** High (during generation), Low (during play)
**Implementation Complexity:** High

- Generate levels asynchronously during loading screens or "travel time"
- WFC can be computationally expensive; optimize with early failure detection
- Cache generated chunks for potential revisiting (memory vs. recomputation trade-off)
- Tile-based rendering highly performant on Canvas
- Seed-based generation enables sharing/debugging

**ECS Integration:**
```javascript
// Components
ChunkComponent: { position, tiles: 2DArray, generated: boolean }
BiomeComponent: { biomeType, ruleset, themeData }
GenerationConstraintComponent: { requiredFeatures, excludedPatterns }

// Systems
ProceduralGenerationSystem: Runs WFC or BSP asynchronously
ChunkLoadingSystem: Generates/loads chunks based on player position
TileRenderingSystem: Efficiently renders tile-based levels
```

### Genre Compatibility
- **Excellent for:** Roguelite, Metroidvania (procedural routes between story areas), Dungeon Crawler
- **Moderate for:** Open-World (procedural wilderness), Puzzle-Platformer (procedural challenges)
- **Poor for:** Heavily narrative-driven games requiring exact layouts

### Implementation Notes
- Start with Binary Space Partitioning (simpler than WFC) for initial prototyping
- Create 5-10 hand-authored sample rooms for WFC to learn from
- Balance variety vs. coherence (too random feels chaotic)
- Ensure generated levels are always solvable (path validation pass)
- Provide debug tools to visualize generation steps
- Consider "directed" procedural generation (guide algorithm toward goals)

### Examples
- **Caves of Qud:** WFC for coherent modular generation
- **Noita:** Pixel-based procedural generation with authored constraints
- **Dead Cells:** Procedural routes between hand-crafted challenge rooms
- **Enter the Gungeon:** Themed floors with authored tile relationships

## 6. Time Loop Mechanics (Knowledge Accumulation)

### Overview
Repeated time loops (minutes to hours) where player retains knowledge/memories across iterations, gradually piecing together how to achieve objectives within a single perfect loop. Death/failure is integrated into narrative rather than punished.

### Core Mechanics
- **Fixed Loop Duration:** Consistent time window (e.g., 20 minutes) before reset
- **Knowledge Persistence:** Information, discovered shortcuts, learned patterns carry over
- **Rubik's Cube Design:** World is a puzzle box requiring specific sequenced actions
- **Failure Integration:** Death/time-out is expected and narratively justified
- **Incremental Progress:** Each loop teaches something new
- **Non-Linear Puzzle Solving:** Players choose what to investigate each loop

### Narrative Integration Opportunities
- Protagonist is aware of loops (no ludonarrative dissonance)
- NPCs follow predictable patterns; player learns their schedules
- Story unfolds through accumulating knowledge fragments across loops
- Multiple endings based on knowledge application
- Emotional weight from watching inevitable events unfold repeatedly
- "Perfect run" where player executes flawlessly based on accumulated knowledge

### Technical Considerations (JS + Canvas + ECS)
**Performance Impact:** Low-Medium
**Implementation Complexity:** Medium-High

- World state reset is essentially reloading initial game state
- Persistent knowledge stored separately from world state
- Deterministic NPC behavior crucial (same actions every loop)
- Time tracking system triggers reset and carries over knowledge
- Journal/log UI essential for tracking discoveries

**ECS Integration:**
```javascript
// Components
LoopStateComponent: { loopNumber, timeRemaining, resetTrigger }
PersistentKnowledgeComponent: { facts: Set, npSchedules: Map, shortcuts: Array }
DeterministicAIComponent: { actions: TimedQueue, seed }

// Systems
LoopManagementSystem: Tracks time and triggers resets
KnowledgePersistenceSystem: Saves/loads player discoveries across loops
DeterministicBehaviorSystem: Ensures NPCs act identically each loop
```

### Genre Compatibility
- **Excellent for:** Mystery/Investigation + Action, Puzzle-Adventure, Roguelite (natural fit)
- **Moderate for:** Stealth (learning guard patterns), Metroidvania (timed sections)
- **Poor for:** Open-ended sandbox games, games requiring long progression arcs

### Implementation Notes
- Loop duration should balance exploration vs. frustration (15-30 minutes)
- Clearly communicate what persists vs. what resets
- Provide multiple overlapping objectives to discover each loop
- Allow players to "break" the loop when ready (final challenge)
- Hint system for players stuck without frustration
- Journal auto-populates with discoveries to reduce note-taking burden

### Examples
- **Outer Wilds:** 22-minute loops in explorable solar system
- **Deathloop:** Combine assassination targets in single perfect loop
- **The Forgotten City:** Time loop mystery with branching paths
- **Returnal/Hades:** Roguelite death as narrative device

## 7. Reactive World State (Consequence Cascade)

### Overview
Player actions create visible, persistent changes to the game world that cascade through interconnected systems, affecting NPC behavior, faction power, economy, available quests, and environmental state.

### Core Mechanics
- **Persistent World Changes:** Destroyed buildings stay destroyed, killed NPCs stay dead
- **Cascading Consequences:** Local actions have regional/global effects
- **Economic Simulation:** Supply chains, trade routes, resource scarcity react to player
- **Political Shifts:** Faction power balances change based on player choices
- **Environmental Reactivity:** Ecology, weather, terrain respond to player actions
- **Reputation + Memory:** NPCs remember player actions and discuss them

### Narrative Integration Opportunities
- Story branches reflect world state (liberated town vs. conquered town)
- NPCs acknowledge player's reputation and past actions in dialogue
- Quests dynamically appear based on world state (rebuilding vs. defense)
- Multiple endings based on cumulative world state changes
- Environmental storytelling shows consequences (thriving crops vs. famine)
- Faction leaders react to shifting power dynamics in story scenes

### Technical Considerations (JS + Canvas + ECS)
**Performance Impact:** Medium
**Implementation Complexity:** High

- World state stored as serializable data structure (persistent save)
- Event system broadcasts changes; interested systems subscribe
- Zone-based tracking reduces complexity (don't track every tiny thing)
- NPC dialogue trees query world state flags
- Efficient spatial data structures for tracking regional effects

**ECS Integration:**
```javascript
// Components
WorldStateComponent: { flags: Set, regionalData: Map, globalMetrics }
ConsequenceComponent: { action, effects: Array, timestamp }
NPCMemoryComponent: { witnessedEvents: Array, opinions: Map }
EconomicZoneComponent: { resources, prices, supplyChains }

// Systems
ConsequencePropagationSystem: Broadcasts effects to related systems
WorldStateUpdateSystem: Maintains world state based on consequences
NPCReactionSystem: NPCs respond to world state and memories
EconomicSimulationSystem: Updates prices and availability
```

### Genre Compatibility
- **Excellent for:** Open-World RPG, Strategy + Action, Simulation + Adventure
- **Moderate for:** Metroidvania (environmental changes), Action-Adventure
- **Poor for:** Linear narratives, arcade games, short game sessions

### Implementation Notes
- Start with 5-10 major world state flags (faction control, key NPCs alive/dead)
- Clearly communicate consequences to player (UI feedback, NPC dialogue)
- Balance reactivity vs. development scope (can't react to everything)
- Autosave frequently to prevent unintended resets
- Allow some consequences to be reversible (rebuilding options)
- Document world state tree for debugging

### Examples
- **Baldur's Gate 3:** Every choice echoes through NPC reactions and world state
- **Fallout: New Vegas:** Faction endings reflect cumulative player choices
- **Mount & Blade 2:** Dynamic territorial control and economic simulation
- **Dragon Age: Origins:** Origin system affects world reactions

## Technical Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation (Core Engine + Simple Mechanic)
**Start with:** Build Customization System
**Rationale:**
- Naturally fits ECS architecture (components are build pieces)
- Teaches proper stat calculation and modifier stacking
- Can start simple and expand incrementally
- Doesn't require complex AI or simulation
- Immediate player-facing feedback
- Low performance overhead

### Phase 2: World Depth (Simulation)
**Add next:** Faction Reputation System
**Rationale:**
- Builds on existing NPC and dialogue systems
- Moderate complexity with high narrative payoff
- Teaches event-driven architecture patterns
- Can be tested in constrained areas before world-wide rollout
- Creates foundation for reactive world state

### Phase 3: Procedural Content
**Add next:** Procedural Generation (BSP first, WFC later)
**Rationale:**
- Start with simpler algorithms (Binary Space Partitioning)
- Generate content asynchronously (loading screens)
- Massively increases content variety
- Foundation for roguelite/replayable content
- Can coexist with hand-crafted story areas

### Phase 4: Advanced Narrative
**Add next:** Either Knowledge-Gated Progression OR Emergent Narrative
**Rationale:**
- Both are high-impact, high-complexity systems
- Choose based on genre direction:
  - **Knowledge-Gated:** Mystery/Investigation focus
  - **Emergent Narrative:** Simulation/Sandbox focus

### Phase 5: Polish Features
**Add last:** Time Loop OR Full Reactive World State
**Rationale:**
- Both require mature systems to truly shine
- Time Loop requires deterministic behavior throughout
- Reactive World State requires all systems to hook into consequence propagation
- These are "capstone" features that tie everything together

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

### Canvas + ECS at 60fps (16.6ms frame budget)

#### Rendering Optimization (~8ms budget)
1. **Offscreen Canvas:** Pre-render static elements (UI, background tiles)
2. **Dirty Rectangle:** Only redraw changed screen regions
3. **Object Pooling:** Reuse particle/projectile entities
4. **Sprite Batching:** Group draw calls by texture
5. **Integer Coordinates:** Avoid sub-pixel rendering (prevents blur)
6. **Layer Caching:** Separate static background from dynamic foreground

#### ECS System Optimization (~6ms budget)
1. **System Scheduling:** Run expensive systems less frequently (AI every 200ms)
2. **Spatial Partitioning:** Grid or quadtree for collision detection
3. **Component Caching:** Cache calculated stats until components change
4. **Query Optimization:** Reuse component queries across frames
5. **Lazy Evaluation:** Defer calculations until needed (off-screen entities)

#### Procedural Generation (Async, not in frame budget)
1. **Web Workers:** Run WFC/BSP in background thread
2. **Chunked Generation:** Generate in small increments with yield points
3. **Seed-Based:** Deterministic generation enables caching/sharing
4. **Early Exit:** Fail fast if constraints unsolvable

#### Simulation Systems (~2ms budget)
1. **Tick Rate Reduction:** NPCs update every 100-500ms, not every frame
2. **Distance Culling:** Reduce simulation fidelity for distant NPCs
3. **Event Aggregation:** Batch world state updates, apply once per tick
4. **Sparse Graphs:** Relationship tracking only for relevant NPC pairs
