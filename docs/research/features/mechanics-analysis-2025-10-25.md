# Feature Mechanics Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Researcher**: research-features agent
**Focus**: Standout mechanics for medium-complexity hybrid-genre experience

## Executive Summary

Based on the genre recommendation (Metroidvania + Investigation/Mystery), this research identifies **7 core mechanic clusters** that differentiate our game from standard Metroidvanias while supporting narrative depth and world-building.

**Key Differentiators**:
1. **Investigation System**: Context-sensitive clue examination beyond simple pickups
2. **Knowledge-Based Progression**: Some gates require discovering secrets, not just abilities
3. **Faction Reputation**: Dynamic world state based on player choices
4. **Environmental Manipulation**: Elemental interactions for puzzles and combat
5. **Time Dynamics**: Day/night cycle or event timeline affects access and narrative
6. **Tool Crafting**: Upgradeable utility items for traversal and investigation
7. **Dynamic Events**: Procedural world events that create emergent narratives

## Feature Cluster 1: Investigation System

- **Ending Variations**: Multiple endings based on choice flags

**Narrative/World Implications**:
- Choices reflect player values and strategy
- Some choices are morally gray (no clear "good" option)
- World reacts to choices (NPCs reference past decisions, factions remember)
- Endgame reflects player's journey (did they pursue truth at any cost? Prioritize safety? Seek power?)

**Audience Expectations**:
- Choices should feel meaningful (not just cosmetic)
- Consequences should be logical (not arbitrary punishment)
- Some choices should have delayed consequences (surprise factor)
- Game should acknowledge player choices (NPCs reference them)

### Opportunities for Our Game

**Unique Twist**: Investigation choicesâ€”player decides which evidence to present, who to accuse, which leads to pursue. Some "correct" deductions lead to dark outcomes; some "wrong" deductions create happier endings. Truth vs. happiness dilemma.

**Required Systems/Content**:
- Choice tracking system (flags per major decision)
- Branching dialogue/cutscenes
- Conditional content (quests, areas, NPCs available based on choices)
- Multiple ending scripts

**Risks & Mitigations**:
- **Risk**: Branching content doubles development cost
  - **Mitigation**: Most branches are small (dialogue variations); major branches limited to 2-3 key moments
- **Risk**: Players feel punished for "wrong" choices
  - **Mitigation**: Frame choices as tradeoffs, not correct/incorrect; interesting consequences regardless
