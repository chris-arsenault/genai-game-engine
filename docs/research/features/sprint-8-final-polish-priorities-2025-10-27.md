# Sprint 8: Final Polish & Production Priorities Research

## Executive Summary

Sprint 8 is the **FINAL sprint** (8/8) to complete the vertical slice for The Memory Syndicate. With 85% completion (7/8 sprints done) and Act 1 at 95% readiness, this sprint focuses on production-ready quality, not new features.

**Target Duration**: 8 hours active development
**Project State**: Act 1 playable but untested live, 99.9% test pass rate, critical bugs fixed
**Primary Goal**: Ship a demo-ready vertical slice with Act 1 fully validated and polished

### Top-Level Recommendation

Sprint 8 must prioritize **validation over creation**. Session #11 delivered all systems—Sprint 8 validates they work together flawlessly through live testing, E2E automation, and final polish.

---

## Research Context

### Industry Best Practices for Final Polish (2025)

Based on web research and GDC 2025 insights:

1. **Vertical Slice Expectations**: A vertical slice must be "as complete (no missing core feature or content) and as polished (no placeholders, first balancing) as possible" for 20min-1hr gameplay
2. **Beta Phase Definition**: Game doesn't fully hit beta until all assets are permanent and all high bugs have been addressed
3. **Release Readiness**: QA must conduct final review ensuring all objectives met before sign-off as 'release-ready'
4. **Last Mile Quality**: Many games get rejected/delayed because of missed compliance or overlooked bugs in the final sprint
5. **Manual QA Essential**: Manual playtesting provides qualitative feedback automation cannot catch

### Session #11 Handoff Analysis

Session #11 explicitly recommends for Session #12:

**HIGH Priority (Must Do)**:
1. Live Manual Playtest - Full Act 1 playthrough
2. SaveManager Unit Tests - >80% coverage target
3. Quest System Testing - Verify branching and triggers

**MEDIUM Priority (Should Do)**:
4. E2E Tests - Playwright/Cypress setup
5. Performance Optimization - LevelSpawnSystem if needed
6. Asset Request Processing - Commission/integrate assets

**LOW Priority (Nice to Have)**:
7. UI polish, quest notifications, save UI
8. Code cleanup, documentation refinement
9. Production-ready build preparation

---

## Sprint 8 Priorities (Ranked)

### Priority 1: Live Manual Playtest (CRITICAL)
**Rationale**: Act 1 has NEVER been manually playtested end-to-end. All validation so far is code inspection only.

**Why This Is Top Priority**:
- Session #11 explicitly flags this as HIGH priority
- Industry best practice: "Manual QA essential for qualitative feedback"
- 95% ready ≠ 100% playable—only live testing reveals integration issues
- Critical dialogue bug was JUST fixed in Sprint 7—needs validation
- Quest branching (Quest 002), count triggers (Quest 001/004) untested live
- Player experience unknown—pacing, clarity, fun factor all unverified

**Scope**:
1. Full Act 1 playthrough (Quest 001 → 005)
2. Test all dialogue trees (5 dialogues, all branches)
3. Verify quest branching (Quest 002: optional objective paths)
4. Test count-based triggers (evidence collection 0/3)
5. Validate UI functionality (quest log, tracker, notifications)
6. Check save/load during progression
7. Test faction reputation changes
8. Verify tutorial-quest integration

**Expected Issues**:
- UI positioning/readability problems
- Quest objective clarity gaps
- Pacing issues (too fast/slow)
- Missing feedback for player actions
- Save/load edge cases
- Performance hiccups in certain areas

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive playtest report with bugs, UX issues, and polish recommendations

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (1hr playthrough + 1-2hr documentation/fixes)

**Risk if Skipped**: Ship a "technically working" demo that players find confusing or broken

---

### Priority 2: Fix Critical Issues from Playtest (CRITICAL)
**Rationale**: Bugs found in Priority 1 MUST be fixed before calling Sprint 8 complete.

**Why This Matters**:
- Demo must be actually playable, not theoretically playable
- Any blocking bugs prevent demo from being shippable
- First impressions matter—broken demo worse than no demo

**Scope**:
- Fix HIGH/CRITICAL bugs found in manual playtest
- Verify fixes don't break existing tests
- Re-test affected areas

**Expected Issues** (based on Session #11 warnings):
- Quest 002 branch logic may not work (obj_optional_informant syntax)
- Count-based triggers might not complete correctly
- UI positioning issues on different screen sizes
- Save/load edge cases
- Performance drops in specific scenarios

**Deliverable**: All P0/P1 bugs fixed, tests still passing

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (depends on playtest findings)

**Risk if Skipped**: Demo is technically complete but unplayable

---

### Priority 3: SaveManager Unit Tests (HIGH)
**Rationale**: SaveManager is a 420 LOC critical system with ZERO tests. Session #11 explicitly calls this out.

**Why This Is Essential**:
- SaveManager coordinates 4 major systems (StoryFlag, Quest, Faction, Tutorial)
- Save corruption would be catastrophic for playtesters
- No coverage for critical persistence logic
- Session #11: "SaveManager Unit Tests - >80% coverage target"

**Scope**:
1. Test save/load for each manager (StoryFlag, Quest, Faction, Tutorial)
2. Test autosave triggers (quest complete, area enter, time interval)
3. Test multi-slot save functionality
4. Test save metadata (timestamp, playtime, version)
5. Test error handling (missing managers, corrupted saves, version mismatch)
6. Test edge cases (save during dialogue, save during combat)

**Estimated Tests**: 25-30 tests to reach 80% coverage

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive SaveManager test suite, 80%+ coverage

**Estimated Effort**: 1.5-2 hours

**Risk if Skipped**: Save system breaks post-release, player progress lost

---

### Priority 4: E2E Tests for Critical Paths (HIGH)
**Rationale**: Zero E2E tests exist. Manual testing doesn't scale—automation prevents regressions.

**Why E2E Tests Matter**:
- Catch integration issues automated unit tests miss
- Prevent regressions in future sessions
- Validate user-facing workflows
- Industry standard: "QA release readiness requires comprehensive test planning"

**Scope** (implement 3-5 critical flows):
1. **Quest 001 Complete Flow** - Start game → complete tutorial case → verify progression
2. **Save/Load Flow** - Play for 5 min → save → reload → verify state persists
3. **Dialogue Branching Flow** - Trigger dialogue → make choice → verify consequence
4. **Quest Log UI Flow** - Open quest log → switch tabs → verify display
5. **Faction Reputation Flow** - Take faction-impacting action → verify reputation change

**Technology**: Playwright (already listed in package.json)

**Deliverable**: 3-5 Playwright E2E tests covering critical user paths

**Estimated Effort**: 1.5-2 hours

**Risk if Skipped**: Future changes break Act 1 without detection

---

### Priority 5: Performance Validation (MEDIUM)
**Rationale**: Game must hit 60 FPS target consistently. One flaky performance test suggests potential issues.

**Why This Matters**:
- 60 FPS is non-negotiable for player experience
- Performance issues often emerge during full gameplay, not isolated tests
- Session #11 notes performance test failures (LevelSpawnSystem)

**Scope**:
1. Profile during full Act 1 playthrough
2. Identify frame drops >16ms
3. Monitor memory usage over 30min session
4. Check for memory leaks
5. Validate GC pauses <10ms
6. Fix LevelSpawnSystem performance test threshold

**Tools**: Browser DevTools Performance profiler, Memory profiler

**Deliverable**: Performance report, fixes for any bottlenecks, stable performance tests

**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour (30min profiling + 30min fixes)

**Risk if Skipped**: Demo stutters or slows down during gameplay

---

### Priority 6: UI Polish & Player Feedback (MEDIUM)
**Rationale**: Small UX improvements can dramatically improve perceived quality.

**Why This Enhances Demo Quality**:
- First impressions matter for vertical slice validation
- Session #11 notes: "Missing auto-start visual feedback for players"
- UI coverage at 42% suggests untested edge cases

**Scope**:
1. Add quest auto-start notification (case 001 starts silently)
2. Fix UI positioning magic numbers (canvas width - 420)
3. Add quest log keyboard navigation (arrows, tab, enter)
4. Improve quest objective clarity (better descriptions)
5. Add visual feedback for save success
6. Polish notification timing/readability

**Deliverable**: Polished UI with clear player feedback

**Estimated Effort**: 1-1.5 hours

**Risk if Skipped**: Demo works but feels unpolished/confusing

---

### Priority 7: Documentation & Handoff (MEDIUM)
**Rationale**: Sprint 8 is the FINAL sprint. Comprehensive docs ensure future work can continue smoothly.

**Why This Matters**:
- Future sessions need clear state snapshot
- Bugs/issues must be documented for follow-up
- Vertical slice serves as reference for Act 2+

**Scope**:
1. Update Sprint 8 summary document
2. Create final playtest report
3. Document known issues/tech debt
4. Update CHANGELOG with Sprint 8 changes
5. Create "What's Next" roadmap for Act 2
6. Store all findings in MCP server

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive Sprint 8 documentation

**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

**Risk if Skipped**: Knowledge loss, unclear project state

---

## Priorities We Should NOT Do (Scope Boundaries)

### ❌ NO New Features
- Act 2 content
- New gameplay systems
- Additional procedural generation
- New abilities or mechanics

**Why**: Sprint 8 is polish/validation, not development. Feature complete.

### ❌ NO Major Refactoring
- Architectural changes
- System rewrites
- Code restructuring for "cleanliness"

**Why**: Risk of introducing bugs in final sprint. If it works, don't break it.

### ❌ NO Asset Creation
- New art assets
- New music tracks
- New sound effects

**Why**: Out of scope for code-focused autonomous sessions. Log requests only.

### ❌ NO Scope Creep Items
- "Nice to have" features
- Experimental mechanics
- Advanced optimization beyond 60 FPS
- Multi-browser compatibility testing beyond basics

**Why**: 8-hour session must focus on shipping Act 1, not gold-plating.

## Risk Assessment

### High-Impact Risks

#### Risk 1: Playtest Reveals Showstopper Bugs
**Likelihood**: Medium-High
**Impact**: Critical (could block demo shipment)

**Mitigation**:
- Start with Priority 1 immediately (playtest first)
- Reserve 2-3 hours for fixes
- Focus on P0 bugs only, defer P1/P2

**Fallback**:
- Document known issues clearly
- Mark demo as "beta" quality
- Provide workarounds for testers

#### Risk 2: Testing Takes Longer Than Expected
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (time pressure on fixes)

**Mitigation**:
- Timebox each priority strictly

- E2E tests: 2 flows minimum, not 5
- UI polish: Skip if time runs out

**Fallback**:
- Cut Priorities 5-7
- Focus only on Priorities 1-4
- Accept "good enough" over "perfect"

#### Risk 3: Critical Bug Has No Quick Fix
**Likelihood**: Low-Medium
**Impact**: Critical (demo unplayable)

**Mitigation**:
- Assess fix complexity immediately
- If >2 hours, document workaround
- Consider reverting recent changes if safe

**Fallback**:
- Mark affected feature as "known issue"
- Provide manual workaround steps
- Ship demo with warning caveat

### Medium-Impact Risks

#### Risk 4: Performance Issues Surface During Playtest
**Likelihood**: Low-Medium
**Impact**: Medium (degrades experience)

**Mitigation**:

- Quick wins only (disable particles, reduce entities)
- Defer deep optimization to future sprint

**Fallback**:
- Document as known issue
- Recommend specific hardware specs
- Add performance mode toggle if trivial

#### Risk 5: E2E Tests Are Complex to Set Up
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (time sink)

**Mitigation**:
- Use simplest Playwright examples
- Focus on happy path, not edge cases
- Mock external dependencies if needed

**Fallback**:
- Implement only 1-2 tests
- Document manual test steps as interim
- Defer full E2E suite to future session
