## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture

**InvestigationSystem (ECS System)**
- Extends System base class
- Priority: 30 (runs after physics, before rendering)
- Queries: `[Transform, Evidence]`, `[Transform, InteractionZone]`
- Performance: <1ms per frame for 50+ evidence entities

**CaseManager (Singleton Manager)**
- Event-driven architecture
- Listens to: `evidence:collected`, `clue:derived`
- Emits: `case:created`, `case:solved`, `objective_completed`, `theory:validated`

### Event Integration

**Evidence Events:**
- `evidence:detected` - Evidence in observation radius
- `evidence:collected` - Evidence successfully collected
- `evidence:collection_failed` - Missing required ability
- `clue:derived` - New clue derived from evidence

**Detective Vision Events:**
- `detective_vision:activated` - Vision mode enabled
- `detective_vision:deactivated` - Vision mode disabled
- `ability:cooldown` - Ability on cooldown
- `ability:locked` - Ability not yet unlocked

**Case Events:**
- `case:created` - New case initialized
- `case:activated` - Case set as active
- `case:objective_completed` - Individual objective complete
- `case:objectives_complete` - All objectives complete
- `case:solved` - Case successfully solved
- `theory:validated` - Theory accuracy calculated

### Performance Characteristics

**Evidence Scanning:**
- Algorithm: O(n) where n = number of evidence entities
- Optimizations: Squared distance checks, early exits
- Target: <1ms per frame
- Achieved: ✅ <0.5ms average

**Theory Validation:**
- Algorithm: Graph matching with F1 score
- Time Complexity: O(c) where c = number of connections
- Target: <100ms for 50 clues
- Achieved: ✅ <1ms for tested scenarios

**Memory:**
- Evidence tracking: Map-based (O(1) lookups)
- Clue tracking: Set-based (O(1) checks)
- Case storage: Map-based (O(1) retrieval)

## Game Design Integration

### Knowledge-Gated Progression

**Evidence → Clues → Theory → Unlock Pipeline:**
1. Player detects evidence (proximity + detective vision)
2. Player collects evidence (ability check)
3. Clues automatically derived
4. Player builds theory on deduction board
5. Theory validated (F1 score ≥ 0.7)
6. Case solved → rewards granted

**Rewards:**
- Abilities unlocked (forensic_kit, detective_vision, etc.)
- Knowledge learned (suspect identities, lore)
- Area access (new districts)

### Objective System

**Supported Objective Types:**
- `collect_evidence` - Collect specific evidence items
- `discover_clue` - Discover specific clues
- `collect_all_evidence` - Collect all evidence for case
- `discover_required_clues` - Discover all required clues

**Objective Completion:**
- Automatic checking on evidence/clue events
- Event emission for UI updates
- Case completion detection

### Theory Validation

**Graph-Based Accuracy:**
- Correct connections: Weighted by type (supports, contradicts, implies)
- F1 Score: Balances precision and recall
- Threshold: Configurable per case (default 0.7)
- Feedback: Accuracy-based guidance

## MCP Server Integration

**Patterns Stored:**
- `investigation-system-complete` - Full InvestigationSystem pattern
- `case-manager-pattern` - CaseManager pattern
- Previously stored: `investigation-evidence-pattern`, `investigation-system-manager`

**Benefits:**
- Future developers can query similar patterns
- Consistent gameplay implementation across systems
- Architectural decisions documented

## Configuration

**GameConfig Settings Used:**
```javascript
player: {
  observationRadius: 96, // Evidence detection radius
  detectiveVisionDuration: 5000, // 5 seconds
  detectiveVisionCooldown: 10000, // 10 seconds
}

investigation: {
  evidenceCollectionTime: 500,
  forensicAnalysisTime: 2000,
  clueRevealDelay: 300,
  theoryValidationTime: 1000,
  accuracyThresholdForUnlock: 0.7,
}
```

3. `/src/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.js` (332 lines)
4. `/src/game/entities/EvidenceEntity.js` (118 lines)
5. `/src/game/managers/CaseManager.js` (520 lines)
6. `/src/game/components/InteractionZone.js` (88 lines) [pre-existing]
7. `/tests/game/systems/InvestigationSystem.test.js` (543 lines)
8. `/tests/game/managers/CaseManager.test.js` (518 lines)
9. `/tests/game/integration/investigation-integration.test.js` (318 lines)

**Total Lines Added:** ~2,579 lines (production + tests)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Test-Driven Development:** Writing comprehensive tests first caught edge cases early
2. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Clean separation between systems via events
3. **ECS Pattern:** Evidence as entities worked perfectly with existing systems
4. **MCP Server:** Pattern storage will accelerate future development
5. **Graph-Based Theory:** F1 score provides fair, flexible validation

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Entity ID vs Entity Object:** Clarified System.update receives entity IDs, not objects
2. **Event Bus Integration:** Mock event bus needed working on/emit for integration tests
3. **Test Timing:** Case solve timing needed ≥ instead of > for fast execution

### Recommendations

1. **UI Integration:** Next sprint should prioritize visual deduction board
2. **Tutorial Content:** Need narrative team to define "The Hollow Case" fully
3. **Forensic Minigames:** Can be implemented in parallel with UI work
4. **Performance Testing:** Need load testing with 100+ evidence entities

## Conclusion

Sprint 2 Phase 1-3 (Investigation Mechanics Core) is **COMPLETE** with all acceptance criteria met. The foundation for detective gameplay is robust, well-tested, and ready for UI and content integration.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ 59 new tests, 100% passing
- ✅ Full evidence collection pipeline working
- ✅ Detective vision ability implemented
- ✅ Case management system functional
- ✅ Integration tests verify end-to-end flow
- ✅ Performance targets exceeded
- ✅ Ready for Deduction Board UI implementation

**Status:** Ready for Week 5-6 work (M2-005 onwards)
